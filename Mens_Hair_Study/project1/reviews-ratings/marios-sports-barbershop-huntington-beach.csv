The owner, ""guy with the mullet"" messed my hair up before xmas and didnt care one bit. He said he will watch out better nex time. There will never be a next time! My fault, I should have ran out the door when I saw his hair!!"

Mario (a Bronco fan) knows, and lives football/sports in general. The two women are awesome especially the hispanic lady. She is super nice and (a super plus is a Raider fan). Great price in haircuts as well as a discounted price for the senior's. I would definitely recommend this barbershop to everyone who needs a haircut and wants to watch sports on tv (ESPN). Also they have hair gel for sale which works great."
8/4/15,-0.207142857,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,I came in and no hello how are none of that. then while cutting my hair absolutely no questions if I want it shorter or if that's okay like normal barber's. He didn't even try to strike up a conversation. Bad service. Only giving two star because the cut wasn't to bad.
6/9/15,0.572,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mario will take good care of you.  I went in with a pic of what I wanted and came out with what my wife said was the best haircut I had in a while.  Been going back ever since.  It's been a couple years now and I'm still there at the beginning of every month.  Prices and service are great!  Highly reccomended
2/21/15,-0.19625,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Worst haircut I've ever seen my husband get. He actually had to tell the lady to stop cutting or he would have had to buzz. He told her to LEAVE his sideburns she chopped one off and tried to do the same to the other My son was given a ""little boys haircut"" its pretty much a buzz. I wish the hubby wouldn't have even paid. I don't know how this lady is even allowed to cut hair. I can do a better job at home. Save your money and your hair from this awful place."

5/31/14,0.525,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been going here since they opened and have always been happy with the experience.Just remember, it's a friggin barbershop not a ""Hair Salon"", if you really want a $50.00 haircut go someplace else...this place is where you go for a $10.00 haircut and a discussion about football!."
5/15/14,0.4,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,My fiancee gets his cut done from Mario and Susan and I have to admit he gets great haircuts every time. I don't know if I am bias but he he always returns from the barber shop with a smile on his face. Whenever I go the barber shop I always see how professionally Mario and his staff are with the customers. So thumbs up on this establishment.
4/8/14,0.85,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,Been going here since 2011.Mario and staff are good barbers and prices are great!
4/4/14,0.466616162,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have been going to this barber shop since 2005 and I have always had a quality haircut at a reasonable price. Mario and the rest of his team pride themselves on  providing great haircuts. They are very professional in the way they conduct business and always wanting the customer to leave happy. The atmosphere in the shop is always lively and a pleasant environment.
3/25/14,0.6375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been going to this neighborhood barber for over 10 years. Mario and his staff are great barbers with really good prices and will cut hair exactly as requested.I would recommend them for a haircut with budget prices and a great value for your money.
1/3/12,0.113224638,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Never EVER again!  This is the worst Barber Shop I've ever been in.  I should've known when I first walked in to a completely empty Barber Shop.  The owner, Mario was too cool or good to cut my hair instead he pawned me off to one of two non english speaking ladies.  I wanted a simple fade and she left me with pock marks on the back of my head.  I asked for a low fade and she went all the way up.  I was clear about what I wanted and she was clear on it as well but i thnk that she continued to foul up and just kept trying to adjust to no success.  This is not why i would not recommend this place.  It's Mario himself.  He's too good to cut your hair which is fine i guess.  But the guy starts talking about how much i should tip them during the hair cut.  Look, i tip well when it is deserved but i think it is the rudest things to reference the tip to a first time customer!  Also, i should have definitely known better seeing that Mario himself looked like he was 10 years overdue on a haircut himself!  Greasy dude.  Poor business ethics and principle.  Dont let the $9 a haircut fool you, once you step inside it's actually a dollar more than what is advertised outside!"
