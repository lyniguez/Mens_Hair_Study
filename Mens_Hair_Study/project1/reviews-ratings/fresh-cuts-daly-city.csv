3/9/18,0.325,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have been going here for just over a year now. Have found few shops and people that can not just cut my hair but my two sons. I look for convenience but quality and Fresh Cuts And Omar are that for me! He is able to get me in most the times I need and gives 3 of us quality cuts!
3/8/18,-0.001491228,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"I made an appointment with Omar.  When I arrived, he was finishing up a client.  When it was my turn, I showed him a picture of the haircut I want.  A conservative haircut, short on the sides but leaving enough length on the top to comb back.  Think Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, or Brad Pitt in Inglorious Basterds.  I'm a middle aged man and I like looking my age.I asked him, ""Can you do this?  Short on the sides, just a trim off the top"".  He shook his head and said,""yeah, yeah. Trim off the top"".I sat in the chair and started to talk about sports.  I realized that he wasn't talking back because he was texting on his phone while cutting my hair. I kid you not.  He even made a call while cutting my hair.Then I realized that I couldn't see the mirror from where I was seated.When he finally finished and showed me the mirror, he chopped off 5 inches off the top, leaving me with only less than 1 inch of hair.  The back of my head had something called ""a high taper fade"".  I never heard of such a thing and I definitely didn't ask for it.  I just wanted it short, instead I see skin nearly to the top of my skull.I paid and got out of there before I let my anger get the best of me.  I would have complained to the shop manager only I don't think there is one.  It wasn't until I got home and looked in the mirror that I realized that he nearly gave me the same haircut as the client before me.  This only leads me to believe that he can only do one type of haircut.So, I'm going to wear a hat for the next several weeks because I'm stuck with a haircut I hate until it grows out. Now I cannot speak of the other barbers, their reviews look solid.  But a lot has to be said about a shop who keeps this guy around judging from the other Yelp reviews (which I should have read before coming).Nothing is worse than a barber who doesn't listen to his clients."

11/25/17,0.019002268,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Barber: OmarService: FHaircut: FOverall Grade: F       Customer service: Omar has zero phone etiquette. Grunting words like ""huh"" ""uh"" ""coo"" and ""yup"" he's not very welcoming in person either. Didn't acknowledge my presence. He looked right at me when I came in but didn't greet me or say anything. He was late on our set appointment by 15 minutes and when I finally made my way to the barber chair I seen his eyes were blood shot red and it all this made sense. While he was cutting my hair he was pre occupied with his phone. Kept taking breaks to check his phone and text without giving me any notice. Haircut: haircut was not up to par. I've had way better haircuts at other shops. He went way too high with my fade and the shear work is below average. He left the top uneven. I was unhappy with the final product. If I'm dropping $30 plus a tip I want my barber to be engaged, and trying to do a good job not high and smelling like weed, Omar seems to be disengaged with his profession. He is more focused on his phone. I work hard for my money and I feel like maybe he should too. Crazy to think this guy was at his job lol."

Pete takes care of me almost all of the time. He's efficient and gives a quality cut. Besides giving a good cut he usually keeps a good conversation, which I believe is an underrated component of getting your haircut. If your going to sit in the chair for at least 30 min you should be having a good time while your there!"

1/4/17,0.152083333,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"Unless you have an appointment, don't bother coming in. These guys are booked throughout the week. The atmosphere is that of a brotherhood, everyone is super chill. I'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a detailed cut, by barbers that care about their profession. Still one of the only 2 shops I would go to in SF. 4 stars because of the of barbers flaked on me even though we made an appointment via text. Ended up getting cut by one of the other barbers."
5/24/16,0.20971917,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Neli is an amazing barber! He really takes care of you, is fair, and incredibly honest. I hit him up because my coworker had this amazing, clean fade that Neli did and I was like, ""Hey man, who does your hair? Hook me up."" You will not believe how many people have complimented me on my hair these past two days, it is ridiculous. I've also been called brave which is hilarious. That aside, Neli scheduled me at the end of all his other appointments because he knew going from normal female hair length to shorter than some men's hair was going to be a challenge. Straight off the bat I could tell I was dealing with someone who not only understood customer service, but actually gave a shit about me. He told me about all the research and advice he acquired to make sure I would be happy with my cut. He took his time and my hair looks sick. I don't recommend him to any woman who wants to take the plunge into near baldness (because this was a very long process and cutting female hairstyles is not his forte), but if your hair is already boyish short or you just want to add an undercut/fade definitely go to Neli. He really cares about his craft and about his customers. Honesty and kindness are the only traits I look for when I pay for a service and he treated me with utmost respect from the moment we connected to the moment I stepped out the door. PS: When I told him the haircut that I wanted, he referred me to a friend of his who might be able to get my hair done perfectly. WHO DOES THAT? I've had so many people compete for business that they will chop my hair into a mess before letting someone else do it. But when she declined due to logistical barriers, he agreed to cut my hair and did an amazing job. PRO TIP: So many people tried to walk-in during my haircut. Always make an appointment, these guys are busy. Plan a week in advance so they can fit you in."
10/27/17,-0.1,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"I booked an appointment with Omar, showed up at my scheduled time only to say he was overbooked. Waste of time. If you overbook yourself, notify your client before they show up and wait twenty minutes in front of you."
12/11/16,0.3375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This place was great! Got my haircut done by Omar and he was very knowledgeable. Definitely had a welcoming vibe from him and the shop itself. I literally don't have anything negative to say. It was a great experience! Definitely a happy camper and will be coming back for my next haircut.
6/30/17,0.366666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Hit up Darwin for a clean cut. I've been to a bunch of barbers and Darwin has bars. $25 for a bald fade.
6/20/16,0.200236742,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Neil is the barber that I always go to see over at Fresh Cuts. I met Neli last year when he worked at the Fine Line. I was changing my look from shaggy to trim for my brothers wedding and Neli hit me with one of his righteous tapers that he is known for. My girl always compliments me when I have a new cut from Neli and then I get tons of head rubs! He touches up all the lines with a straight blade so it looks sharp a$$. I really like how professional Neli and the other barbers are over at Fresh Cuts. And the dudes have tons of trophies from Barber competitions to boot. The owner had just won the fastest taper at a big competition.the shop is really clean. The music is always bumping so I would recommend you check them out if your looking for a fresh cut!Also be sure to call and make an appointment for your cut. These barbers are busy most of the day because they have tons of repeat customers.
8/29/17,0.083125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been going to the location for over an year now. It's a very friendly and family oriented location. Pete has been cutting my son and I. His hair cuts are always on point and he works with my son really well. Gotta give him credit my son squirms like a worm on a hook. Pete has always been very helpful with scheduling. I work construction so the hours are crazy. Pete seems to be able to fit me in always. Even though I can switch appointments multiple times in a week. Highly recommend this spot. If your looking for a reliable and friendly barber, from my personal experience no knock on the other fellas, Pete is your guy"
9/9/16,0.151909091,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I'm new to the area and needed a haircut for the past month. Walking in I wasn't sure if I needed an appointment or not but Julian was able to provide service for me. (Highly recommend making an appointment) Julian is a real chill dude who knows what he is doing behind the blades. I was in need of refining a new look and he achieved it with out a doubt. I enjoy the new look and the talk we had.
4/4/16,0.175268158,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place gets five stars because of...1. Neli, who takes his time making sure he gives you the cleanest fade. I followed him when he moved over from Fine Line because he cuts just the way you want it. And he's always talking about his training and barber conventions and stuff, so you know he takes it seriously and wants to make your hair perfect.2. The shop itself. It's big and spacious. It's clean. They got a big tv playing ESPN. Every piece of furniture looks new and kept up and they are comfortable to sit on and lounge if you have to wait a little bit. 3. It's right next to In-N-Out and Krispy Kreme so when you're done getting your fresh cut, you can go chow down on some really good burgers and donuts."
1/4/17,0.1875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Been getting cut by Sherm for years. Parking is a breeze and every time you go in its like hanging with the boys. All the barbers in here are really friendly. If you're in need of a solid cut schedule an appointment here!
1/18/17,0.585,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Been getting a cut from Pete for over a year now and our conversations are great! He definitely knows what he's doing and will take his time to make sure you're happy. Always satisfied when leaving!
8/15/16,0.138043478,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"It's a shame that Yelp does not let you give no stars because this is exactly what this place deserves.First off don't go in there with your last haircut looking like it's more than two weeks old.. They will look at you as if you are an alien.These dudes are full of attitude and really feeling themselves and they are mediocre at best... I have lived all over the world and have seen better talent in 3rd world countries and Europe.. Why are folks giving them 5 stars?? Try getting a haircut outside of the Bay Area sometime and you folks will see what i mean.Got my haircut once by this clown called Norbert (Norb) and he did not look too happy to be cutting my hair (two weeks hair growth) was too much work for the $40 man  I guess ... lolHe handled me like his daddy had told him I was dating his mom or something... I Left their with whiplash.... Heavy handed indeed I am sure that he could have qualified for the U.S. Weightlifting Olympic teamOh... Don't try making another appointment with him or another barber once the ""haircut "" is done as they will only tell you to call on Tuesday... Huh???? But I am already here.Like other reviewers have said they never answer the phone.Overall impression.. They are the best of the worst.. Well at least better than Philgood butcher's... oops.... I meant barbers, and trust me that is not a ringing endorsement... It's like having to choose between Donald Trump and Sarah Palin for president"
2/17/17,0.24375,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I've been getting cuts every week since i was in 6th grade, sometimes 2 to 3 times.. its somewhat an addiction. Im from LA and i visit my girl up here about twice a month. I come up here every time with a fresh cut, but sometimes i stay longer and i need that. For the past two years i've been coming up to SF, they have never picked up my phone calls. All the other reviews say not to walk in since they're booked all the time, so i never even bothered to try doing that. They look like some good barbers that can chop it up by the looks of their pictures. I just don't understand how a barber can be content with the amount of clientele they have.. as a barber you're supposed to want to expand that and grow more and more with the community. I pay top dollar for my cuts and love tipping my barbers fat, but unfortunately they wont be able to experience that from me. All they gotta do is pick up their line. Don't get me wrong i'm going to keep trying lol.. but this is just how i feel."
4/17/16,0.4203125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"5 Stars because of the amazing service provided by the one and only Neli! Neli is by far the best of the best. Not only at perfecting every cut, but at making sure his customers always leave satisfied, and most importantly, looking fresh. He genuinely cares about his clients, and he makes sure to show it every time you step into the door. The effort and care he puts into not only his cuts, but getting to know his clients is what will keep me returning to Fresh Cuts. His skills are top notch!"
3/5/17,0.35225,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Huge shout out to Pete, haven't been to an actual barber in a very long while, I'm always wearing hats and don't care much to spend the money for a good haircut, after some years of paying for the cheap $12 and crappy haircuts decided to show some love to hair and found fresh cuts through yelp, called and quickly was booked with Pete for the next day.  Super good vibes, definitley knows what he's doing, left me super happy with my haircut and will for sure start coming here from this point on. Highly recommend him and I'm pretty sure everyone else is just as good."
6/30/16,0.483333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Neli is a chill dude and he always gives me a nice, clean fade. Even people at EDC were complimenting my haircut that I got from him."

8/11/16,0.239285714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Took my son there for the First time. He was totally nervous (past bad experiences). I made an appointment with Neli. Neli not only took the nervousness out my son he kept my son involved throughout his cut. My son is totally hooked on Neli for all his future cuts. I totally recommend him, he is awesome, funny and very personable. My son will be his client going forward..As a mom if my son is happy then I am happy. Thank you Neli for a great experience!"

Call the place let them know what you want and they will buzz you up. They are by appointment only , so call ahead. Don't get all butt hurt if because you can't do a walk-in. Bring in a picture of what you want. These guys cannot read your minds. These guys have skills just let them know what you want."
2/3/16,-0.044545455,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"As is the practice in the bay area, I have a couple of trusted places I go for a hair cut. You need more than one spot because the demand is that crazy high, and nearly none take ""walk-in's"", but work off of appointments. Fresh Cuts is one of my trusted barbershops. I've frequented this shop periodically over the past three years and never had a bad or questionable experience. All the guys (Josh, Marc, Darwin, Frankie)  are cool and hospitable and you can't go wrong with either of them. Close your eyes and point to any chair and you'll leave very satisfied."
2/2/16,0.381060606,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been going to Fresh Cuts for over 5 years now. Great atmosphere and everyone treats you like you are family. Julius was my original barber and for the last 3 years Josh has been my main barber. Nothing but awesome things to say about this guy. He takes the extra effort to make sure he understands and can give his clients exactly what they're looking for. Not only that, Josh and the rest of the Barbers take a vested interest in continuing to improve their skills, learn fromothers in the industry and share that knowledge. I always feel great walking away from my cut there."

Dude knows how I want it every time without me telling him, that's how great of a barber he is.

He kind of reminded me of doctor the way he asked questions to see what kind of cut you really wanted. Then when he began cutting he was very meticulous, and thorough. I have found my new shop."

The fade was on point for doing it the first time. Ive gotten my hair cut at many barbershops and they never get seem to get it right the first time. Fresh Cuts did. The shop is very clean and modern. Iwould definitely go back. Keep up the good work guys."
2/9/10,0.090480896,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I created an account just to give feedback to this place.I've been to most of the places to get lined up or a taper around San Francisco and even some places at San Jose. This place is close to the worst. I came here because someone in my class told me about this place. I used to get a lot of my haircuts from the fresh cuts on mission so I thought why not.I tried to get a haircut during winter break from college. i called a helluva lot of times for a week or two, never getting an answer. Figured they must be really busy with it coming close to the holidays, so I eventually drove to the actual place. Darwin, who is supposed to be one of the better barbers, came off rude (which is weird, I'm a new customer.... which means more money). A barber near the door told me that the price would be 15 for a taper which was great. I couldn't schedule an appointment there, but he told me to just call using the number on the door.So I kept calling, and no one answered. Finally drove again to the place, and finally found a barber with a spot open for the following Thursday or something. When i came in for the appointment, dude named Darwin asked me how I got the number for the store, and I said it was on the door. I later found out that when they're ""extremely"" busy, they don't pick up the phone. When I was getting cut, I realized they don't answer the phone if they don't know your number either. Coincidence, eh. So the guy giving me a taper takes an hour and half to finish. Cuts me ALL over the place. My bald taper was for some reason halfway up the side of my head (like close to the top), and I was charged $20!!!! I had a feeling my barber was either new (which I doubt), or just is used to giving inadequate cuts.Oh yeah. Halfway through the cut, my barber and the other dude named Darwin lights one up and smokes it. Wtf.Worst Experience ever. Would definitely not recommend."
3/22/13,0.12592381,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Out of every barbershop I've ever been too, this has got to be as bad as they come. The location and shop are both very clean and neat but when your in a business dealing with customers constantly, it's good to have the right customer service skills. When your a barber in life it's your job to make every person feel like you have their back and want the best possible service to be handed to them. These group of young boys have terrible service when It comes to dealing with customers. Your not supposed to tell customers that your too busy to cut them and when someone shows up its a room full of barbers taking breaks. I've been getting fresh cuts for my whole life and I know exactly what I want and how it gets done but these dudes swear they are cutting back to back like the busiest place on earth when in reality it's as calm as they come. You guys really need to evaluate your customer service skills by going to a college course or something because you guys clearly don't have it all together. ""FRESH CUTS DALY CITY"" not the right name. I have a friend who cuts out of his home and can gather more clients than the entire shop , but will never use the line ""I'm booked for the entire day man"". Get it together or business will dive."

Once i moved to Daily City and a cousin told me about this place i havent went no where else. Josh has mad genius skills when its comes down to cutting hair. Just like any barbershop not only do you get a haircut but you talk to the barber while your getting cut so time goes by really fast. I live in Mountain View and commute to Daily City whenever i need a haircut now, Loyalty comes a long way when you need a fresh haircut and i highly recommend Josh"
