3/26/18,0.30030303,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This barbershop was extremely clean, my highest priority when looking for a new barbershop. I had messaged the owner at 10am and she was extremely helpful and was able to get me in same day. The haircut was exactly what I asked for and came out better than I had expected! I will be returning here for sure. Donna did an excellent job!"
10/1/17,0.221805556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I called in and booked an apt 2 hours beforehand. I arrived 15 minutes early, they sat me within 10 minutes.  My barber was Jeff. He was very attentive to my confidence in the haircut the whole way, stopped several times to make sure I liked the length. That's something you rarely ever  see in barbers these days. Feel of the barber shop was Very casual, everyone was smiling, laughing, or engaged in some unbeknownst man-cave conversation. The bathroom was roomy and clean. Would definitely visit again and recommend. Stay Classy Gentleman!"
12/14/17,0.359183673,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Donna is great.  She shampoos & cuts my hair for just $30 and trims my beard for another $15.  It's well worth it and she does a great job.  Her shop is conveniently located on PCH in Corona Del Mar.  There are only two chairs in her comfortable shop, both for men only, so no stinky hair products and gossiping women as in the large co-ed salons.  I look forward to seeing Donna (she should have her picture on Yelp...it would help her marketing) and getting my haircut when I'm on the West Coast."

10/16/17,0.57625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,The owner/barber was great. She gave my husband the best haircut and mustache trim he has ever had. She was very professional and friendly.
2/1/17,0.373055556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I am a very loyal creature of habit. When I find something that works I will stick with it forever. My last hair cutter Holly worked with me for 20 until she retired to be with her family full time. I was devastated until I was lucky enough to run into Donna in the village. She surpasses my last barber because of the added straight razor neck shave and a wonderful scalp massage. Plus, she is very reasonably priced. I've been going to her for the 2 years I've lived in Corona Del Mar and what a treat being able to walk to my barber. It is also nice to support a local!Go see Donna...you will be happy you did."

Luckily, I stumbled upon Donna in CDM about a year & half ago and have been a loyal & happy customer ever since!Donna is hands down the best barber/hair stylist I have been too, she's friendly & professional and gets the cut & style I'm looking for just right every time... I'm not sure how I'd replace her if I ever end up moving back to Europe! Would highly recommend Donna to anyone looking for a consistently great haircut at a competitive price."
10/3/17,0.266077441,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been getting my haircut by Donna for about 5 months now, the search for a GREAT and consistent hairstylist was finally over! I'm always walking out satisfied that my hair looks as best as it can. I'm moving to Portland and unfortunately have to start a new search. Gonna be hard to find the talent AND the looks Donna has :)"
8/6/17,0.46,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Nice location with parking. Donna is an experienced professional. This is a great value. I'll be back!

9/6/17,-0.059090909,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"Saw Donna after reading all the great reviews. Whole lotta attitude, very mediocre haircut. Need to get a new haircut because this one was a waste: hair always looks messy and uncut. Didn't get what I asked for."
10/20/16,0.154630019,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Cliff notes are at the bottom if you're not into a good read. First I'll give you a bit of background. There is about half a dozen of us late 20s early 30s groomsmen & groom combo. We're a risky bunch when we're together and turns out we don't plan ahead well either. The motto of this group of guys is ""I'm gonna wing it."" and that's precisely what we did.We called about a dozen barbers to get our beards and necks/burns trimmed up the day before the wedding. The results? Well, we were called everything but a bunch of white guys and hung up on mostly. The word ""crazy"" was said to us time and time again. We were down and out; until we called Donna.After we became as charming as a bunch of southern democrats who can wheel and deal, she actually said she would open her store and hour early to get us all in. We were in, and we were in shock. Not only is Donna is easy on the eyes if you know what i mean ;-) but she trimmed us all up and we looked great for the big day. Extremely affordable too.She asked how I wanted my beard trimmed and I told her I wanted the ""George Michael special"" and she quickly dissuaded me. I'm glad I listened to her, otherwise I would have had a porn star-esque beard with a dangley cross earing at my buddy's wedding. Bride would have been pissed. Google image search George Michael and you'll know what's up.TLDR; Donna's professionalism, skill set, and business mindset not only earned our business but ensured that we will return when we're back in town. Highly recommended as we had great results and a great experience, minus the debilitating hangovers that we were battling from the previous night's debauchery, but that's a different review to write for ourselves."
7/6/17,0.197546296,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"Donna does great work. Every time I have gone in for a cut I have left more than satisfied with the outcome. With little direction she understands what I want and delivers. Donna's shop is artfully decorated and always scrupulously clean. She has graciously accommodated last minute grooming needs and provided me a consistently high level of service. Donna takes her craft seriously and it shows. She had been the individual responsible for my cuts for more than four years and I do not see myself seeking alternate services in the future. If you're looking for a great cut, in a classy setting, by a real professional, look no further than Newport Barber."
12/16/16,1,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Met Donna today and got my haircut. I'm very happy with how it turned out. I would recommend her to anyone!
7/30/15,0.433333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Whether you are a local or staying in a hotel, go see Dona at newport barber. She is skilled in her trade, gives a great scalp massage and you can book online on your iPhone :  newportbarber.com. My son is 3 and she cuts his hair too. I am so over the $65-75 ""salon"" haircuts.  I like getting my hair cut every 10 days and Dona handles that for me.  Thank you Dona. Justin and JakeWww.justinkautz.com"
9/18/16,0.269949495,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Got a haircut from Donna. Friendly, professional and an artist with my hair. Best haircut I have ever received and I am in my 60s. My hair grows different ways and is difficult. After her cut it looked great. Normally you go home and wash your hair and it never looks the same. It is a week now and my hair grows fast. I shampoo it, brush it and it still lays down as if it was just cut. Amazing!!!  Customer forever."
8/20/15,0.14534632,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Donna is the only hair stylist I trust with my hair in O.C. She is always prompt, friendly, and an expert at cutting hair. I've been to other stylists who have made me wait long past my appointment start time because they were behind schedule, but Donna is always ready to see me at my exact appointment time. She is also very polite and easygoing, which makes getting a haircut from her a pleasant and relaxing experience.In addition to providing great customer service, Donna is also a pro at cutting hair. She's great at making suggestions for different styles and cuts without being pushy. I usually come in with a photo for what style I'd like, and she always makes good suggestions and alterations based on what I initially suggest. She seems genuinely concerned that her clients leave with the right style, product, and confidence that come from a first-rate haircut. Donna is also a master beard trimmer so I always get a great haircut and a neat beard trim from her for just the price of a single haircut.  $30 is a steal for the quality service Donna provides."
2/24/17,0.540833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,If you want a great  haircut experience I'd highly  recommend Tanya to shape you up. She's consistent and very pleasant.
2/7/17,0.576666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best hair cut around town... quick, efficient, and great conversation. Booking again and will refer to anyone that is after a haircut or even better a hot shave."
9/10/16,0.380555556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Donna is AWESOME!  She is careful and precise - a very skilled barber.  I take my 14 year-old son with me and he loves her too.  He likes that she does not ""blab at him"" like his previous hair-cutter.     = )"
11/2/15,0.388571429,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Donna has been cutting my hair since moving out here from NYC. Great haircut, very thoughtful and attentive stylist, and great hours, which allow me to get my hair cut after work, that sort of thing. Don't look any further. Go see Donna in CdM for a great haircut."
7/28/15,0.135521886,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"it doesn't get better than Donna.  She absolutely nails the haircut every time, and that's one less thing to think about in the hectic day-to-day craziness.  I will be her customer for as long as she stay in Corona Del Mar.  Love her new spot at The Lab Hair Studio.  Her last spot, CDM Barbers, was clearly holding her back.  Thank god she moved."
9/11/15,0.288293651,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been a client of Donna's for over a year now. I have always found it hard to get the barber do my hair right. Donna got it right the first time and she continues to repeat it. She just KNOWS hair like no one else. Now my son and I go together. Absolutely the best in Newport.
9/15/15,0.30952381,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have had my hair cut all over this country from NYC to LA and Donna is by far the best. She takes her job very seriously and is the quintessential of a perfectionist with clippers. She focuses on every aspect of your hair and will not be satisfied until every area of your hair is even and styled just the way you want it. I might be moving to the UK in the next year and one of the things I am worried about is the fact that I don't think I'll find anyone better. You can show her a picture or tell her what you want and she will create just that! Definitively worth every penny!
7/27/15,0.35,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have recently moved to the area and was looking for good barber since I miss my old one back home. I am so happy to find this place since I am very picky. Donna was amazing! It's like she knew what I exactly wanted. You have got a life time customer.
2/4/16,0.365357143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been going to Donna for years.  She is the best around and is very friendly.  She is very attentive, pays attention to detail and gives a high quality haircut.  Donna is very professional and always on time.  She always listens to my suggestions and tells me what she thinks from a professional standpoint.  I would highly recommend."
11/30/15,0.44047619,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Donna is absolutely the best and always delivers a great haircut - she is extremely consistent. She is also always a pleasure to see and you will look forward to a haircut with her each time. I have never had anything less than a great experience with Donna.  I really recommend her.
9/4/15,-0.3,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,Moved here from the East Coast and I bounced around trying to find a quality barber for over a year and finally found Donna at CDM barbers (stay clear of there ) I followed her to Newport Barber and I recommend that you do it also you won't be disappointed! 5 stars at Newport Barber !
9/17/15,0.194444444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Donna has cut my hair for the past year and does a fantastic job. I don't know the technical details of cutting hair, I just know my hair looks really good when gets done cutting it. She also gives an amazing scalp massage that should put most customers to sleep in the chair. Perhaps I am biased, but she is arguably one of the best at her craft in Newport Beach."
