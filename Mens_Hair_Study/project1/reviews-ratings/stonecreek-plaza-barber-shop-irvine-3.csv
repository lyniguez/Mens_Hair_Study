4/10/18,0.135127592,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"After I found out my barber of 5 years hung up the clippers, I embarked on the dreadful journey of finding a new barber. I was forced to check out yelp and ask friends for recommendations. Luckily, my best friend referred me here and lemme tell you how that dreadful journey turned into a perfect ending. Upon calling the shop, I was greeted with a friendly voice as Tina easily set me up with an appointment the same day. The shop is kept organized with water and snacks provided as you wait for the chair to open. I'll admit that I was nervous, trying out a new barber for the first time, but once I explained her what I wanted, she got to business. Her skills and warm personality made me feel at ease and I knew that I found my new go-to spot. I'm extremely happy with my haircut especially since she knew how to work with my Asian hair. I will be referring all my friends to get their cuts here byIf you're like me who lost their barber or still searching far and wide, stop what you're doing, book your appointment and rest knowing Tina's got you."
4/7/18,0.40625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I had an amazing experience getting a haircut here, they are incredibly friendly and did what I asked them to with my haircut. I'm very pleased and will come back here again."
4/6/18,0.3,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been a returning customer of Stonecreek Plaza Barber Shop for a long time now. Before this, I've been hesitantly going to other barber-shops around the OC area, always nervous that I would not get a result that I would be happy with. Tina, the store owner here, is always so inviting. She offers her customers water to drink and snacks to eat upon their entry. She really takes care of her customers' hair and never rushes it--she makes sure you look good and that you leave satisfied. Her staff is also reliable, since she hires them herself and would not let anyone unworthy to work for her. If and when you come to Stonecreek Plaza Barber Shop for your next haircut, you will leave with a smile!"
4/6/18,0.335416667,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I came here because I needed a quick haircut when I visited my family in Irvine. I saw the good reviews and came here and got my hair cut from Tina. The fade was good but she just butchered the top of my hair. I've been to a lot of expensive and cheap, but experienced hair stylists and watching her aimlessly shove her scissors into my hair was not acceptable. I don't usually write reviews but this business is not 5 stars"
4/3/18,0.45,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Magnificent ""mom & pop"" shop in Irvine that is second to none. Terrific customer service and even better haircuts. I am happy that I found this establishment, and I am a permanent customer of this fantastic barber shop."
3/23/18,0.109198836,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"5 Stars for Tina and company! Boom! Tina is a Rockstar, multitasking killer barber with competent business instincts. Always does a bang up job and makes sure you're satisfied before you leave! Can make an appointment or walk in; if you walk in, they will make you wait and Tina will stay late to make sure your needs get met. I almost felt bad for her as she had two walk ins upon closing up so Inevitably she stayed late to make sure they got their cut. Only negative is that they Always have boring television programs on. Tina let's get some ESPN running or maybe a little CNN news! Haha Great place and super friendly!!!"
3/15/18,0.270416667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been coming here for 5 months now since I've moved to the area and Tina has ALWAYS given me exactly what I ask for, every time. She can always squeeze me in with her busy schedule which I really appreciate. Tina and her employees are super friendly and welcoming to everyone who walks in the door. There is plenty of bottled water and snacks to have while you wait as well. I will not go anywhere else!- George"
3/12/18,0.082692308,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"This place is getting popular. Sad thing about small businesses is that their capacity to run the business is small as well. With just Tina and few others doing finances, setting appointments and running the whole store, they are getting over loaded with more customers than they can take care. Of coarse they want to make more revenue so they accept all appointments at near as possible times that the clients request but they won't be able to start you on time and the quality of the cut is getting sloppier and sloppier. Not to mention the two other hair cutters except Tina are amateurs. Time to find another place."
3/5/18,0.464285714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Tina or Angie. Either 1 of them is probably the best hair stylist you'll find in Irvine (For me, they are even better than the hair stylist in LA). They even have a free snack bar for you while you wait. Great customer service, great skills, and i'll be back.  ohhh.. the PRICE = small damage to you wallet"
2/24/18,0.433333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This is my second time visiting here. They have done a great job. I am quite satisfied with my hair.
2/12/18,0.3625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This was my first time visiting Stonecreek Barber Shop, and I couldn't be more satisfied. Tina was awesome and extremely accommodating, but most importantly did a fantastic job with my hair. She even followed up with me after my haircut to see if I was entirely satisfied. If you're looking for a quick and clean haircut, give this place a try.Tina is a true professional, and I'll definitely be back again!"
2/12/18,0.346666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Easily the best haircut I've ever gotten accompanied with the best haircut experience I've ever gotten. Easy-going, light, quick, conversational, and convenient. With a price tag of $18 for a basic haircut, I really cannot go wrong here. Make sure this is where you get your follicles fixed."
2/3/18,0.1,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Tina is always very accommodating and will work with you on what type of cut you want. I would recommend on making reservations on the weekend since gets quiet busy during the weekend.
1/31/18,0.4375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great haircut with reasonable price. Honestly one of the cleanest/neatest cuts I've had so far. The barbers there seem to be very experienced. Also the service is really great, they'll occasionally offer you donuts and some water if you have to wait. They definitely know what they're doing!"
1/29/18,0.231384451,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is hands down the best spot for men's haircut. No tricks, frills or fancy stuff. You get in, get out, CLEAN CUT every time. Being a full time financial advisor and full time Dad, I don't have the time or money to go to these fancy salons charging 30,40,50 dollars. I just need an efficient place where I can get a clean cut during lunch or after work. Believe it or not guys, I found just the spot!!! This is THE place. Professional, efficient, quick and consistent. How much does all that cost me?? $18 plus tip. Get the hell out of here...like no way right? In Irvine too? Let me tell you, this is real. If you aren't getting your cuts here you are missing out or spending too much money. Trust. The owner Tina is so nice. Always asks me how my day is going. Remembers my family and asks me how they are doing. One time I forgot cash and Tina didn't want me to waste money on ATM fee so she let me pay her the next time I saw her. Like who does that?!?! This place is a gem and if you are contemplating your next trusted barber get your butt over here and get cleaned up."
1/25/18,0.17979798,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,First time haircut (traditional cut) by Tina.  I have typical Asian hair and the true test is whether my hair sticks out or lays down nicely after washing. Tina took her time and really nailed it!  Very pleased to find such a expert barber who charges a reasonable price.
1/23/18,0.361111111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been getting my haircut by Tina for the last year, and I've never been happier. She's an amazing barber who treats her customers with exceptional service. I'm writing a review because she goes above and beyond for her customers. Tonight, I had an appointment at 6, but didn't get there till 6:30. She greeted me as she always did with a smile, and gave me an amazing haircut.When you get there, let Tina know I sent you."

Great haircuts (especially fades), not expensive, and always friendly and courteous service. Tina and Lee have always been very kind and professional. Make sure to call ahead and make an appointment! It can get busy sometimes."
1/23/18,0.021428571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Tina is the best barber.

There is bottled water and snacks if you get the munchies.

1/22/18,-0.333333333,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,My husband went for a haircut on Saturday.  He came back home with bruises on his neck. I can't imagine what horrible hair dresser can make such a thing. I don't recommend going there! !!
1/19/18,0.577777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,The best barber shop. Takes extra effort to make the experience and the result pleasant.
1/10/18,0.266666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Tina is great. She told how to style my hair without making it a sales pitch. You'll recieve the same quality haircut as you would at a salon that charges $50. This is definitely my go to place now.
1/9/18,0.139652015,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I'm a regular! and a regular with kids!This tiny little shop has nothing externally special about it, quite the opposite actually!  But the service is top notch and you find yourself endeared to the barber shop by the owner and hair stylist who always makes you feel at home.  I take my 3 year old and 1 year old and they do a great job with them and are very patient!  They both get lollipops after!  Hidden gem."

12/30/17,0.339827806,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Short and sweet, regular cut for $18; CASH ONLY (Which I already knew). Lee was my barber and he was great! Asked me what I wanted and then trimmed a little to make sure I was good with the length. Tina was there and very friendly! Good atmosphere (To me). I went there a few days earlier and saw they had a wait; so I called for an appointment (Recommended). They took me right away. This is what I was looking for; just a haircut with no frills and a good price.Will be returning!!!"
12/23/17,0.307747253,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Wow!  My first time to this barber shop and I was so impressed from the first moment I walked in to the hand shack when leaving. Tina, the owner, greeted me with a warm smile right when I walked in. She knows how to run a business. Offered me a beverage while I wait.  I was early - she asked if I had a reservation and acknowledged I would be next for my appt time.  Just fifteen minutes and I was in a chair for my haircut with Lee. He did a great job. Very busy barber shop and highly recommend calling ahead for a reservation.  Will definitely be back."
12/21/17,0.339166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I came here because I recently transferred to UCI and it has good reviews and pricing. I decided to stick with this barbershop not only because of how good the quality of the haircut was but also how warmhearted the owner (Tina) and her staff are. I was immediately greeted when I walked in and they offered a bottle of water while I was waiting. I was served by a lady and she was very responsible and efficient. I was not disappointed with the result and I would stick with this place for the rest of my school years.

12/5/17,0.338666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I initially came in because of the reviews and the best pricing in Irvine.  I've stayed because Tina and her staff are very attentive, kind, and hospitable.  They also cut hair nicely and quickly.  And I've tried many different barbers...(FYI, I have typical Asian hair.)"
12/3/17,0.521333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Awesome barber shop and very clean cuts. Tina is the best. Definitely book an appointment if you're making your way over. It gets very busy.

11/25/17,0.21780303,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I wanted to try a new barber that was convenient and close to home so I decided to give this place a shot. It's a nice little barber shop with friendly service. They offer you water and candy while you wait. Trying to find a new barber can be a drag, but Tee took real good care of me. She gave me the cut I wanted. I couldn't be happier. Definitely will be coming back again."
11/22/17,0.4875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best haircut and doesn't hurt your pocket, friendly owners!Haircut is $18 but I think it worth more than that! Will come back and recommend for sure!"

11/18/17,0.252083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Tee does a great job with my haircut every time! She left her old spot where I met her and when she told me she's leaving to come work at Stonecreek I had to show love and bring my business here. Very confident with her cutting my hair she's been my barber for over a year now. I without a doubt recommend her for your barber if you want a proper and clean finish.

11/9/17,0.164285714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Tina has been handling my hair cuts and facial hair needs for several years now. She is skillful, and a perfectionist. She gets right to it and makes sure all the details are done correctly. The end results have never been disappointing. She delivers all that and has a great personality too. No reason to go anywhere else."
10/16/17,0.4265625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great barbershop for the price in Irvine. I'm not willing to pay $35 for a standard men's cut like some places charge so it was great to discover Tina's barber shop here which starts at $18 for a mens' cut. She gave me a great haircut and is very skilled at doing all kinds of fades. Tina was very friendly as well. Will be coming back.
9/24/17,0.094117647,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great barber.  The person cutting my hair roasted me in front of the other customers which was rather funny.  The hair cut was spectacular.  I came with with some god awful hair that a different barber shop (we shall save them shame and embarrassment by keeping them anonymous) expecting only a marginal improvement as to not look like a complete fool until my hair grew back enough to get a complete redesign of my head but the barbers we skilled enough to make me look like Prince Charming, even with my shirt and messed up hair.  It was also cheap compared to other shops around that area.  One downside is the wait time, I had to wait around 20 minutes but I didn't make an appointment before walking in."

8/25/17,0.119444444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"A pretty small shop and it sucks they do not have walk ins at all. You got to schedule an appointment for any of their services. To be honest, it was pretty alright for the value that I paid for this haircut. It was $18 for a decent cut. I wished they do some promotion or deal. Some things need to change in order to succeed."

8/7/17,0.233333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Tina is as good of a barber as I've ever had. This place is GOLD, especially in Irvine where your alternative is the crappy barber shop next door or dankcuts where you have to shell out $40 for a trim."
8/4/17,0.335689655,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Tina is an amazing barber. I never write reviews but she deserves the praise and has definitely earned my business. If you're like me and has trust issues with people cutting your hair, it's safe to say you're in good hands with Tina.She communicates very well with her customers and makes sure they are getting the haircut they want. She will not be satisfied until she knows you're happy and it's her dedication to her customer's satisfaction that makes her my favorite barber of the dozens of barbers I've tried. I've really come to appreciate how much time she puts into personalizing my haircut whereas other barbers would try to give me a standard haircut and hope I'd be happy with it. I'm always comfortable with her cutting my hair because she cares and she is a very skilled barber. Aside from her business etiquette and standards, she's a very honest person and a nice lady.Definitely call ahead of time. Her shop is very busy and I always have to call a day or so in advanced. I have so many good things to say about Tina and her shop that it would be silly for me to list them out in a Yelp review. Give them a shot and you'll see why they're always packed and why she has so many return customers.Long story short, Tina is dope and they make my hair look good. Really good."

After giving up on barber shops for a while because of price or the simple lack of availability without an appointment, I decided to check this humble place out after seeing the sign on the road after heading home from getting my car washed. Outstanding, professional, and absolutely friendly and sincere barbers! Tina and the gang are awesome!"
7/21/17,0.368055556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Nice place for haircut. It's hard to find a good barber in Irvine. Now I finally know where I can get a best haircut and the price is also reasonable.
7/19/17,0.246153846,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"For all of you that are debating if you should get your haircut here this is the review you should read. I have been going to this barber shop since they opened. The owner, Tina, is so sweet and kind. Every time I walk in she always gives me a hug and offers me water or what ever she has to drink. Ever since my first time coming here I have had Tina cut my hair. She does an amazing job. I personally have been to cheaper places (that cut hair for $9) and expensive places (that cut my hair for $50) but Tina does a better job than all. I consistently go back at least once or twice a month. I rarely leave reviews but I feel like this shop and Tina deserve a good and honest review."

After searching several OC barbers, I came across Tina at Stonecreek Plaza Barber Shop. All the positive reviews about Tina are very accurate. She is very patient, friendly, and meticulous with cutting your hair and explaining why she cuts your hair a certain length but also listening to what you want. Great first experience and I may have found my new go-to barber."
7/8/17,0.548287037,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Outstanding!! No wonder of the great review... Tina, thank you for giving my son the haircut he always wanted. We are so happy to find this place.  It's behind H&R Block in an office building. Tina is very pleasant and customers are none stop.  Walk ins are welcome, but I feel a reservation is better.  This will always be the place for my son when we visit Irvine. =) Thanks Tina."

6/23/17,0.212,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I usually never leave a YELP review but wow!! What a friendly place! This is the best haircut experience I've ever had and it didn't even take that long! I usually hate talking to macho guys in barbershops but as a queer woman I totally enjoyed interacting with Cody. He's such a chill guy with a good sense of humor. Made me totally at ease. The other woman was also very friendly and nice. I said I only wanted a trim off the top because I get insecure about having it too short but Cody recommended I get it shorter for that volume I was looking for and damn! I love it! Thanks Cody for making me feel handsome! Definitely will come back. Even though I'm not even in the area! 3 thumbs lol UP!the only drawback: no razor lineup! Buzzers only

6/6/17,0.259635417,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Had my hair cut here yesterday. Tina, the owner, is very friendly and communicative. She offers you a drink as soon as you walk in. I usually get my haircut in different places just to try other people out but I think this will be my Hair Home from now on. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and just let them cut your hair. They have the experience and talent to know what looks good on you. I was just a walk in and it took about 45 minutes, so if you need to get out more quickly make an appointment. This is by far the best haircut you can get in Irvine, and it's half the price of most other professional Men's salons. I'm guessing its a matter of time before they raise their prices, but even at 30$ the cut is still worth it."

5/22/17,0.111207311,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Before coming here my boyfriend would just go to some random salon to get his haircuts but because some of the haircuts he received came out looking kinda funky we decided to try some place new and close to where we lived. And we definitely do not regret that decision.My boyfriend called in to schedule an appointment and even though we came in a bit early but they took us in right away. Everyone there was very kind. Their hospitality is on point. They offered snacks and drinks during the wait. Tina even offered me some donuts that she received as a gift from one of her customers! The shop is a bit hidden but it is definitely a gem when found. This place is now my boyfriend's new go to!

Its usually pretty hard to find a place that can work with asian hair and doesn't charge you an arm and a leg for it. Here I received a super fresh fade :D in very little time, at a low cost, and the owners were extremely friendly and accommodating. This is definitely my new spot for a cut!"

Great 3 chair barber shop in stone creek plaza, Tina had 2 clients before us, she was so hospitable offered us something to drink while we wait, we decided to wait in the courtyard very peaceful setting. Her barbering skills are spot on she is great!! Love her style very much, we showed her a picture and then she modified it to our liking. Very pleasant experience Tina, I noticed you have a full clientele and we are so grateful you fit us in on such a short notice. Plus the thank you text was a nice touch what a awesome Barber! We will make this our shop for sure Kevin Love's His Hair!! Thank You Tina!!!!"

2/12/17,0.343754209,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Excellent work, reasonable prices, always accommodating and very friendly. That sums up my experiences with Stonecreek. I live in the OC part-time and I've found it a real challenge to filter through the numerous barbers in the area. I've tried a couple with little more than a ""meh""  experience. I read an early review about this place and decided to give it a shot. I was originally paired with Tina upon my first visit and it's been a great experience. She's very fast, yet careful and precise. She listens well to requests and has the skills to do the job. I like that Tina always makes sure everything is correct before letting me leave. She's always sure to get me a refreshment upon visiting. Tina also remembers me and spends the time to have real conversations, which causes me to feel like a valued customer. The little things mean a lot. Tina is also very good at accommodating my schedule. She's always been able to get me in the chair for a haircut--it's actually quite amazing! If you want a great haircut at a reasonable cost, Stonecreek is my best recommendation."
1/20/17,0.15625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have been searching for years trying to find a barber that can cut my hair without making me look like a dork. Tina did a fantastic job giving me a professional sharp look while being very personable. She will be my barber for years to come!

I called to see what time they closed since it was a holiday and Tina waited for me to get there even though they were closing soon. She told me she wanted to make sure I looked good for New Years. It was a great hair cut, cheap price for Irvine area ($18 CASH ONLY), and she was the nicest person. Definitely recommend."
12/23/16,0.14725,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been looking for a place in Irvine to get my haircut since moving to the area back in August, and I can definitely say that this place will be my go-to. I had a little trouble finding this place within the plaza, but I'm sure it didn't help that it was already dark and I myself can be directionally challenged sometimes haha. Staff here is extremely friendly and offered refreshments while I waited. I didn't make an appointment, but I didn't wait very long at all. This is probably the best price for a quality haircut you can get in Irvine, and I'd recommend them to anyone!"
12/16/16,0.271130952,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is THE SPOT. Especially for those with the ever so troublesome Asian straight and thick, hair. Tina is like the Asian hair GURU. Tina was SO much fun to listen too and chat with. Small little setup, perfect for what she is doing it. She saw my hair and noticed all the things my previous barber screwed up on and did her best to fix it all and I can't complain about the end product. She's got a customer for life with me. Wishing you all the best Tina!Best thing Tina said to me, ""Don't worry, it's the holidays. I'm going to make sure you look good."""

Hands down the best people and best cuts in Irvine. I've been a customer at Jim's shop since I was a kid and it's refreshing to find a place that's as customer friendly and consistently good. It's always about the people and Tina, Jim, and Billy are the best."

For example, I once had a 10:00 flight from John Wayne but needed a quick trim before a very important business meeting. Not only did TINA open her shop early to accommodate me, but I was treated to an incredibly professional trim that helped boost my confidence. Stonecreek Plaza Barber Shop is #1 in my book."
