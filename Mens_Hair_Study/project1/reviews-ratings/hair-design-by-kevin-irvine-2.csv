If you got any questions or don't really know how you want your hair cut, just talk to him and he'd be more than happy to help you out with that. I have referred a couple of my friends to him and they have all had a great experience. He responds to you very quickly and makes it easy to set up an appointment with him and even willing to see you the same day, if time permits. Overall, Great cuts, professional, and a really nice guy. If you need a haircut and you are around Irvine he is definitely worth visiting for a clean cut."

However, when I got my hair cut here he cut one side of my top hair way to far up and left the other top side super long. I guess he was trying to give me the ""comb-over style"" but it's taken me about a month to regrow that length of hair. I prefer the hair to fall down but he just went with the buzzer from bottom all the way up if that make sense. I said not to touch the length and just the sides but I guess he misunderstood. Again very polite guy. If you want that kind of haircut (comb-over) go for it. Maybe he's good at other styles not sure. Just not what I wanted/expected from the reviews."

Kevin is the absolute best- when the Haircutters closed in the same center, Kevin was hired by Interfashion and I'm so glad he is there! I've gotten to know Kevin over the past several years and he is just a great guy, always does a great job with my hair every time. When I took another job in another county, I STILL drove to Irvine for a haircut because Kevin is that good, and reliable. Super friendly, and very professional."

He listens to each person's requests and consistently provides quality haircuts. He is easy to get in contact with to set up an appointment and will always find a way to accommodate your availability. I have referred multiple other males to Kevin and they have all been very satisfied with the results. I highly recommend Kevin's services if you are a male looking for a friendly, affordable, and stylish haircut experience. Regarding female hair services, I have also brought my girlfriend to Kevin for styling and hair coloring (hombre). The process was quick and the results exceeded expectations. Furthermore, we were prepared to pay a hefty fee but were delighted with how surprisingly reasonable his prices were for such a skillful job. As women's haircuts and coloring generally require large financial and personal investments, be sure to put your trust in Kevin's hands to guarantee that your requests are done correctly by a professional."

I found Kevin on Yelp and decided to give it a try. He was very nice on the phone and set an appointment for me. When I arrived I didn't have to wait too long to see him and he did a wonderful job with my hair. I left looking exactly how I expected and was very happy with the result! Even the ladies next to me complemented my hair after Kevin finished his job. I plan to come back for some highlights soon! Very pleased! :D

The only thing i wished was that he used a heat protectant spray before blow drying my hair, which is what other hair stylists have done in the past for me. That would be the only con. Overall, had a good experience."

When I moved to California, I tried a hair cut at a salon where is near Da Lat supermarket, and you know, my hair was terrible. After that, I was looking for a hairstylist on Yelp, I found Kevin. He cut my hair, change my hair's color, and talked to me friendly. I must to say this is the best haircut that I have ever gotten. Try that!"

I have been getting a haircut from Kevin for one year and he never goes wrong. When you want a specific haircut, he double checks with you if you want that haircut or something different. Also, when setting an appointment, he always replies quickly and ensures you get what you want. He also recommends and gives you an unbiased opinion on what would be the best for you. He never lets you down!"
