3/19/18,0.366005291,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Lalo hooked me up with fresh cut today. Clean fade with a straight razor for a nice finish. I was able to walk in and got service right away. 21 bucks plus 10 for tip. ALWAYS leave a decent tip for good work! If i lived in the area I would come back.

9/16/17,0.313444444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Lincoln Barbers is the quintessential, old school shop that has expert barbers who are dedicated, talented and professional at their trade! Very clean and inviting, Lincoln Barbers has a loyal following of men and their kids who pack the place almost all of the time. They have renovated barber chairs and the staff keeps the place immaculate!All of the barbers are excellent and their prices are remarkably reasonable given the gentrification that has taken place in that part of Santa Monica. They always have sports on the television with magazines for reading as well when waiting. They also have a drinking fountain and the barbers are precision cutters who have the talent to keep the line moving and the wait fairly short when you consider the volume of heads!Today I arrived at closing and they were nice enough to let me in and get a quick cut. Lincoln Barbers value their customers and they are rewarded with loyalty as they have many regulars!Lincoln Barbers is a 5-Star quality establishment that will quickly earn your business and loyalty. I can't say enough about this place!"
1/30/18,0.025555556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Really solid, inexpensive, low key neighborhood spot. I went in with a mop full of ridiculously curly hair and an unclear vision of what I wanted it to look like. They were able to see me immediately on a weekday afternoon and Eli worked some serious magic on it. The only thing to keep in mind is that it's cash only, but that definitely helps to keep their prices as reasonable as they are. Ill be going back to Lincoln for the foreseeable future."
8/11/17,0.30625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,They were nearby so I went for it. Walked in they were welcoming but serious about the craft. My hair is pretty easy; zero all the way. My dude used the soft brushes and stuff yeah!Then he finished with the straight edge and warm shaving cream. Now I gotta shave the rest of my face :) good times
7/16/17,0.311904762,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Soto did an absolutely amazing job with my fade with a hard part. He actually recommended something other than what I asked for and I am so glad I trusted him. He did a great job and everyone's been noticing how good the haircut was. Fully recommend Soto - as well as making an appointment.
8/22/16,0.01875,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I always feel anxious about going to barber shops, but I was really surprised and delighted by Lincoln Barbers. I feel like the girl cutting my hair really cared and paid attention to detail. The haircut was only $18, cash only, and they're conveniently open on Sundays."
1/24/17,0.65,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I love this place! My man Chino is always doing a great job! Appointments only! Be sure to get with chino! He ALWAYS does a great job!
9/10/17,0.25625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Quick service! I had a hard time finding a barber near my home. Jasmine did a great job with my son's haircut.
8/4/17,0.48,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Was in the neighborhood waiting on Toyota service, so I searched for a nearby barber.  Without an appointment, I waited under 5 minutes and scored the shop owner, Raphael. He gave me an awesome cut,.. this place is the real deal!  I'd expect to pay more for a quality cut like this.  They don't take credit cards anymore for the record, but they do have two parking spaces they leave available for their customers.  There's also metered street parking.  Thanks Raphael!  See you again."
5/1/17,0.666666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Marcos and Chino are top notch here at the shop. I've been getting my hair cuts from this shop for about 14 years +. Well staff shop everyone is highly skilled but would recommend Marcos. Life hack- call ahead of time to schedule for an appointment if you want to be in & on your way with an awesome haircut in a timely manner.
10/18/16,0.28410637,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Made it in right as they closed. Still welcomed me. I got a skin to no. 1 fade From two different barbers now and the results are perfect. I'm waiting for my longer hair to grow out so I can clean up the lines so, they worked with me on that. This is my new place. Well worth the $$."
1/28/17,0.132843137,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Just walked in for a casual haircut and left with an amazing fade that I would've probably had to pay double for at Beverly Hills salon.I will definitely come back here! Came on a Saturday and sat and waited for about 5 minutes. It was packed but it moved very quickly since they have a line up of barbers buzzing and cutting away.What's really unique about this barbershop is that they are happy and willing to cut and thin out the hair whereas when you go to another traditional barber, they don't gladly offer those extra services.Very happy with the cut and fade.. will definitely be back!!"
5/7/17,0,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,im here at 3:30pm on a sunday and they wont let me in. sign on the door sais they close at 4pm and i see people inside waiting and getting cuts. wasting my time driving here
7/22/17,0.327672078,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I just moved to Santa Monica from New Jersey New York area. We have some of the best barbers in the county and it's taken me a very long time to find that perfect barber who can cut what I ask. In the last few months being here I've been to a few barbers now and decided to stop into Lincoln Barbershop. I was seated RIGHT AWAY. I didn't get his name, but the FIRST barber on the LEFT as you walk in seated me. I told me what I wanted (mid tape all around light trim) he did an amazing job, a perfect cut and in great timing. Some barbers try to get you in and out, some barbers cut you for over an hour! This barber had the timing on point, and did a great job. Highly recommended. FIRST CHAIR ON THE LEFT!"
8/10/16,-0.580833333,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"The ABSOLUTES WORST barbershop. The only place I've ever been to where the client is facing AWAY from the mirror at all times. I specifically told the moron cutting my hair to not use the machine but since the client is facing away from the mirror, he used the machine and then argued w me that he didn't WHILE HE IS HOLDING THE CLIPPERS! How do I argue with that? It's like saying its night time at noon! I got up half way through the haircut and still gave him the $18. DO NOT GO to this hell hole."
7/17/17,0.128125,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,I've had good haircuts here but don't go to the dude all the way in the back there's a reason he's back there. Trash haircuts you mine as we'll get your little sister to give you a fade.
5/19/16,-0.049305556,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"If you're from the hood, and skeptical about getting a fresh taper in the area, then look no more. I go to ucla and usually go back home for a taper, but Marcos got down! My skin shaved taper is on point. Thanks Marcos! Definitely coming back!"
1/9/17,-0.65,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Worst barbershop I've ever been to (including Esquire on Montana Ave).  The guys don't listen, face you away from the mirror so you have no idea what's going on and show you something you didn't ask for.  It'll take me at least 2-3 months recovering from this butcher.  Garbage place."
7/20/16,0.33,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,The barbershop with all the wants and need you want for a haircut. All barbers are courteous and ready. Please keep in mind to call ahead of time. It is best to make an appointment. Walk-in are accepted but might just wait a bit long. This is a respectful establishment whom provide great services. I know there are folks out here that like to criticize without being in the place for no more then 3 times. Like I said you won't go wrong. Keep up the great job Lincoln Barbers.
6/21/16,0.071645022,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been coming here for 10+ years now & literally found this place by trial & error! In life, everyone needs 3 things- a CPA, a doctor, & of course a barber. Flat out, Chino is the man. A true entrepreneur,  I've been with him thru several new store openings & as busy as this guy is (trust me, he works really hard, every day), he always gets me in & really knows how to deliver a perfect cut in a relatively short amount of time. Whether its a taper, a bald fade- whether you're black, white, Hispanic or Asian- Chino knows what he's doing & won't steer you wrong. I highly recommend!"
9/25/16,0.220833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"A barber shop should be a few things in my opinion: quality service, consistent and relaxed. Lincoln Barbers does both of these things and even better, has quick service and is affordable.Each time I walk in, there is no more than a 10 minute or so wait - and once in the chair, they get to work quickly and I walk out happy with the cut. After trying several shops in Santa Monica, this is now my go-to every 5 weeks."
4/1/15,0.105669643,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Steven is a cool guy but he has some strict rules I'm not used to have at a barbershop. I called the day of my appointment because I wasn't going to make it and there was a $5 dollar cancellation fee. That's ludacris but I was okay. I called right back and he switch me to 1hr later. I arrived 6 minutes late to find out he skipped me. He looks at his phone and says ""7 minutes"". Is very obvious that the guy was sitting on the chair for a good 2-3 minutes.When I asked if I was going next he said he has someone else and that he is very strict. This is not good etiquette at all. And he wasn't very nice about it. I had to get up and walk out because he was going to let me sit there all night I guess. Never going back. Horrible service. I consider myself a good customer but this is just not cool."
12/26/16,0.313528139,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been going to Lincoln Barbers since they opened up this new branch. And I won't go anywhere else. Why? Chino, that's why. He's the man. Terrific guy, great haircuts, economically priced. Who could ask for more? Not me. Quick tip: Call and make an appointment for Chino. He gets busy!"
12/7/15,-0.333333333,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,Went in today and asked for 3 and bold taper. It came out to look like a 2 all around. Horrible hair cut. Never coming here again
1/19/15,-0.093219955,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Let's just say I can't wait for this to grow out. My barber was very nice and respectful, even calling me sir, but this haircut is terrible. He continued to go over the same spot numerous times, moving to another spot and then coming back to the same area. He never even loosened up the neck wrap to do the back of my neck, or even tilted my head to get a better angle. He was constantly swiveling my chair back and forth instead of just moving around my head, then he would assume an awkward position, standing to my left, then reaching across me to cut the right side of my head. It was just strange. My neck line is curved like an inverted horseshoe, high in the middle and lower on both sides. I hate to post a bad review like this, but seriously, I'm considering taking time off work so I don't have to be seen like this. It's that bad."
1/15/15,0.353571429,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I called & booked an appointment.The shop was easy to find with clear signs outside.Lovely welcome from all the staff.Large, clean establishment.Received a professional buzz & fade cut from Fernando.He was Fun and friendly but didn't talk too much.Cut was $22.Definitely return again."
1/23/15,0.130833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I popped in on the off chance that they do women's hair.I get quite a short cut and usually go to a barber anyway.They did cut my hair for me and I was so glad they did.My barber was Tony and he was lovely.My head felt like it was being massaged and he did just what I described I wanted done.20 dollars and a five dollar tip.Bargain.I highly recommend the cut and the barbers...super friendly and I learned something about Call of Duty while I was there.I will be back on my way from abroad if time permits.Thanks guys.
7/26/15,0.277929894,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,Wow. Wow. Wow. I've been searching for a while for a barber that could get the haircut I've been wanting. They got it right here. My barber was super friendly and super patient with me while I explained what I wanted. She would show me as she cut my hair to make sure I was satisfied with the process. Bottom line: quality haircut for an affordable price with very down to earth people. My kind of establishment! Highly recommend.
7/3/14,0.082954545,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"Sorry but don't get cut by the lady. I came here to try it since it was so cheap ($15) and I just wanted a simple trim. I have a bald taper faded into a mohawk.After trying to shave the top, I had to continually ask for a little more off of each side as to try and get the pointed shape. She proceeded to tell me that it wouldn't work because of the way my hair grows. I had the shape when I came in! I decided it was a lost cause and had her just finish off the rest of the line-up with a straight razor.I guess I'd only go back here for simple buzz cuts or tapers, but I would wait for one of the other barbers."
9/20/16,0.8,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Awesome barber shop.  Dennis gives the best cuts IMO but everybody is good I'm sure.
6/5/15,0.309214876,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I get my cut from ""Chino"". He has always been accommodating and thorough. He is very detailed. It's been a pleasure doing business with him. Been coming to him for over 7 yrs. and loving it. He's got very reasonable prices. He's been at his new location for over 4 yrs and it looks very successful. He's next door to Bay Cities Italian Deli, which is a plus. (Great sandwiches and an old-school Italian eatery) I highly recommend trying this Barber Shop. You won't regret it. They take appointments or walk-ins. They stay long hours also, 7am-7pm."
10/24/14,0.223284314,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I found this barbershop on a whim because I was running late for another barber shop appointment and traffic was too bad so I walked into this shop. I was very happy that this barbershop takes walk-ins. Every chair was filled which I took to be a good sign. There were three people ahead of me which moved relatively quickly. The haircut itself did take a while to complete however I am a firm believer in that a good quality haircut usually takes a little while. The shave with a straight razor was just what I expected.Overall I am very happy and if I lived closer I would most definitely return againHelpful hint: they only accept cash so make sure you have cash with you or you use the ATM while you wait.
8/29/15,0.366666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Asked for Navy regulation hair cut and that's what I got.  Great to find a real barber.  Even the clipper used felt and sounded like professional clippers.
11/20/14,0.052083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have a regular barber I see here, but the few times I haven't been able to book him, usually because I try to book at the last minute, the other barbers have consistently done an amazing job.I recommend this place 100% to anyone who is in town for a vacation, or a local looking for a regular barber.The prices are also completely reason, usually between $20-$30."
7/31/15,0.465,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been coming here religiously for almost 10 years.  I've never gotten a razor fade as good as the one I get here...and I've gotten fades in all corners of LA.  Marcos is amazing, professional and i've never, ever gotten a better razor fade than what Marcos does.  It is the best barber shop, and prices are extremely reasonable.  Chino has built and sustained a great small business; support this place and get the best cut in LA."
8/29/14,0.51875,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"These guys do a great job! I rarely see much of a wait. The barbers are cool guys. Polite and not overly talkative if you're the kind of jerk that likes to just sit there and stareat the wall until you're done (like me).And I've always been pleased with my haircuts. Of course they finish with a straight razor too, which I appreciate. $15+tip  Awesome."
10/10/13,0.024165982,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"Today I walked into Lincoln's barbers with expectations that I was going to get a fresh cut. The store itself looked pretty nice and for $15 I definitely felt like it was going to be  a great deal. A lady sat me in her chair. I was quite surprised because I never had a woman cut my hair before in a traditional barber shop. It was hard to communicate with her because she spoke very little English. I showed her a picture of the type of haircut I would like, but told her the adjustments I would like to make personally. She starts cutting my hair and fading my sides. I had to ask her twice to fade them shorter because she kept on insisting that I come back within 2 weeks to continually have my sides cut. Nearing the end of the cut I ask her to cut a little more in certain parts and she denied my request because it wasn't ""in the photo"" I showed her. To me personally,  a good barber is willing to sit down and continue cutting until the client is satisfied. I was very shocked that this lady was unable to do that. I go home only to check later that my hair was cut unevenly. I do not plan on coming back to Lincoln barbers as a regular customer. There are other quality barber shops in the area."
10/22/15,0.328138528,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Today I met Soto. Walking into a new barbershop, in a new neighborhood is always a coin flip. I won with this flip! I got a fade, and a hot shave -- and with any hot shave the feeling is amazing, but, a lot of trust goes into the patron/barber paradigm when you are allowing an unknown person hold a straight razor to your neck... and although the worry is often based on the customer being shaved's experience, the nerves of the barber are also thoroughly tested because there is a fine line between doing a great job, and losing their job.I just wanted to give Soto the compliments he deserves. He did a phenomenal job, and made me feel comfortable the entire time. The prices at this establishment are great, and id recommend it, and Soto, to anyone looking for a new barber/great haircut and shave!"
10/14/13,0.16092437,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"The price is right... but you get what you pay for.  My true beef is with their shaving. I've had two straight razor shaves there and both times my neck has been cut up and razor burned for days. This past Sunday I had a shave and when I got home I noticed that the woman who I had let me leave the shop looking like SHIT with all sorts of shaving cream and/or blood-stop get all over my neck. She shaped my beard too but even that needed to be redone when I got home and looked at how uneven it was in many places. I won't ever get a shave their again. At least this time I was given the full treatment with a hot towel over my face during the shave. The first time there was none!That being said, I definitely could find a more than comparable cut and overall experience elsewhere for similar or slightly more cost. This will be my fall-back fall-back place for sure from now on."
12/24/12,0.33975,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Simply the best! Each barber knows how to cut hair, very friendly employees. RAFAEL is  phenomenal. I know why they call him the master barber. He really treats his profession as his craft and is very detail oriented. I 've been to other places, twice as expensive,and let me tell you they don t even come close.Clean, friendly, just an amazing place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1/20/13,0.203846154,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I've been to this shop a total of 4 times. I've had my hair cut by 3 different barbers. I showed each barber the same exact photo and explained in great detail precisely what I was looking for...yet each time I received a completely different cut that didn't resemble the photo I presented.They would say things like ""you know the cut in that photo is very short""...yes, I'm aware...that's why I asked for it. Thanks.If you're looking for something cheap and mediocre, this is the shop for you...although I advise you to give Great Cuts a try, since they're cheaper, have more TVs (that you can actually see), and will provide you with a similar-terrible-haircut.Seriously, I'll never go here again."
6/12/13,0.35,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great cut (female), great guy, great location and unbeatable price!!!!I definitely recommend this place!Haircuts for kids available as well.I'll come back with the entire family!"
11/12/14,0.29,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I've gotten several cuts here and have been generally happy with them, although there were a couple of cuts where a a couple weeks afterwards, some unevenness in the cut became apparent. It's inexpensive and there's a chill, no frills/old-school vibe. When they leave the door open you get a nice sea breeze while getting your haircut."
12/27/12,0.088944444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I started getting my cut by Steven over 2.5 years ago and have never looked back. This guy is popular, so make an appointment if you can.He just does a damn good job without fail. He recently started shaping my beard, too, and I get complimented accordingly. So I swing by before any business travel or major event to look sharp. He does a good fade, blends everything well, cuts nicely with a bare blade, and cleans up all those hairs with a high pressure air hose.Way back in the day, Floyd's was my place to go, but quality started dropping, so I switched. The crazy thing is, Lincoln Barbers is way cheaper and SO MUCH better. These guys could charge more. So I always leave a healthy tip in good conscious.Two bad points. One is that you need to have plenty of time. Steven and several of the other guys I know take pride in their work. That means you may need to wait if you don't have an appointment, and your own cut will take a little while.The other thing is parking. There is only metered street parking. I usually go after work and have found parking, but it may take a round or two. The meter stops running after 6pm. The place is located near Lincoln and Broadway, between Swingers and Bay Cities Deli.This place hasn't been around for 2.5 years, but I have followed Steven through his previous locations, including the other Lincoln Barbers further south on Lincoln, which has a cozier barbershop feel."
9/8/14,0.086805556,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"This place is great, well Chino is the guy to go there. You tell him: I want this and this, and he may ask a few questions but he always gets exactly what I want. Alert: he won't let you see the final product until he's finished with the scissors and clippers, so I'm thinking 'damn, is he going too short?' I see hair falling down, and keep thinking the same question over and over again. The final product though, always what I asked for, so you gotta trust him."
5/29/14,0.273454545,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best barber I've ever been to! these guys are not afraid to be precise and give you EXACTLY what you ask for. I showed the guy a picture and by the time it was finished, my friends told me that he copied the style in the picture to a T. Although I've only had the same guy each time, I'm sure that the standard of barbers here is very high. It's an old school barber with modern techniques and it should not be overlooked by passersby. This place is the business!"
8/30/14,0.425,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Love these guys. Always a good cut, and all of my friends that I have referred have become dedicated customers as well. Just make sure you get one of the guys - the only cut I didn't like was from the lady."

10/6/15,0.319166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Extraordinary service and quality. I have had many of the barbers here cut my hair and they all do an excellent job. I no longer worry about having to wait to get a specific barber, I normally walk in and in a chair within 5 minutes. Beats an overpriced hipster shop where you have to schedule an appointment then get a mediocre haircut for almost triple the price. Quality of the cut is hard to beat, and the atmosphere is great. Great location and I enjoy every visit."
6/18/14,-0.135714286,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,Worst customer service. I went there at noon and Dennis (one of the barbers) told me to come back at 1. I was there 12:50 and sat there for 30 minutes till he finished with somebody else. Then apparently he had said the same thing to another person as well. Both of us were waiting there together and he didn't care to say to one of us to come back later. My last time ever there.
9/24/13,0.43125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been a regular here for some time now. Great environment, great price, and great cuts. I stick to Robert. The man knows what he's doing. If you guys are looking for a great cut make sure to make an appointment with him. They have a small parking in the back but you might have to stick to the meters. With that said this is the place for a cut anytime."

It's really simple - you get a great haircut for a reasonable price ($10 and up depending on if you get a buzz or something else, lineup, etc...)The staff is always nice and accommodating, and even on a busy Friday, they'll squeeze you in.My favorite thing about this shop is that whenever you come back, they always remember you and treat you like family. It reminds me of the shop I went to in New York as a kid. I always looked forward to getting my hair cut then, and I still do now."

7/31/12,0.302597403,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been going to Lincoln Barbers since they opened.  Actually, I have had Chino as a barber since I was 15.  20 years plus later, I have never had a more skilled and thorough barber, period.  I travel a lot between the Bay Area and Santa Monica and I would go months without a haircut, simply because I only trust Chino with my hair.  He takes his time and applies his skills, and the results show it.  Heads up: you should probably call ahead for an appointment (great service is always in demand) or expect a wait.  I always try to go on Wednesdays as it seems as though appointments are always open that day, walk ins on that day are good as well.  For you fellas that like fades, Chino has the sickest blade out there and he has trained all of his guys how to command the blade, so you are good with any of the barbers, but Chino is the master by far.  I feel like a billionaire when I walk out of there with a new haircut and my attitude shows.  If you want to look and feel great Lincoln Barbers next to Swingers is the place to go."

Price is good.. My guy is Robert... Super chill dude and can cut with the best of em. I tell all my friends to go here. They work with you on apt times and I have never had a bad experience yet... Crazy to see bad reviews on here.. I give it 5 stars!! What what!!!

But now i come here because they give a dope haircut EVERY time. Ive been thru a couple of the barbers here, each guy does a great job and the whole situation there is very friendly so you feel comfortable.As far as the barbers go, Fernando (w/ the hat) is the dude that takes care of me. He's always on point, very nice and knows what hes doing. Also, every time I'm there, i notice that the majority of people that come in for a cut know the guys that work there. A lot of people have their guy, and keep coming back. I got a dude that i work with to finally come in for a cut, and he wont go anywhere else now.I highly recommend this barbershop, and my homie Fernando (w/ the hat)"

Go to the guy chino he's very polite and knows his stuff. Got to talking to him said to play ball at the YMCA down the street, dudes got game too! Anyways one of the best shops I've  been too. I recommend this to everyone!!!"

Fernando has cut my hair a couple of times - the guy takes serious pride in his craft! I highly recommend Lincoln Barbers - especially for the price point.And the Bay Cities Italian Deli (next door) parlay? Fuggedaboutit!"

12/18/12,0.546111111,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,Most of the barbers here seem to take great pride in their work and provide very clean haircuts. Some are better than others but overall this shop seems to be the best in the area.

9/25/12,0.313636364,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have been coming here since they have opened the shop. The guys at lincoln barbers know what they are doing. Most barber shops have only one good barber this shop has FIVE plus barbers that cut all type of hair and do it well. The best barber is STEVEN and one of the most talented ive seen in a long time. He cuts all type of hair and i have never heard one bad negative comment about him. But he is busy so MAKE A APPOINTMENT with him ahead in advance. BEST BARBER SHOP IN SANTA MONICA AND IN A 20 mile radius.
9/13/11,0.104931973,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Spanning 15 years of having my hair serviced by Rafael (Chino), owner of Lincoln barbers, I am extremely proud of haircuts gotten here and the shop expansions. Lincoln Barbers treats with their respect to everything they do.The haircut I have gotten most at Lincoln Barbers is the fade, executed with such precision and care that ladies inexplicably would stroke my head, wishing for this haircut to always be around.The chill vibe of Lincoln Barbers mixed with old-style service make this place a golden institution in the area.Close proximity to SMC, Venice, Samo, UCLA, and unbelievable prices fit a student and worker's budgets well. Elementary school crazy hair days were brought with sick shaven designs-squares, bull's eye, cornrows, half/half, etc. The care put into these cuts was the same extraordinary care that is put into every haircut they do.Lincoln Barbers and Rafael serve the best cuts around."
4/13/12,0.327937861,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,There is a generous amount of barber shops in Santa Monica and I have to say Lincoln barbers is my #1 choice!!All the barbers are super down to earth always in a good mood and always striking up interesting conversations as I wait for my cut from vegetable juice diets to biking.  Great customer relationships.  I get my haircut by Steven and I'm always looking for a fresh new look from short hair to long hair and Steven always does the job very well always changes the style of my hair and a great look never fails and after my cut the shoulder/back massage is always a plus!! Kudos to the new shop.
3/30/12,0.388210227,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best barbershop in the city (Santa Monica and LA), as far as I'm concerned.  Bottom line, I've been coming to Chino at his shop (original one and now #2) since 1999.  He's well skilled at what he does -- best fade and line-up you could get.  He's cool people and is always ready to talk basketball.  The new shop is big, bright, clean, and parking is pretty easy (if you use your head).  I've referred several people over to Lincoln Barbers throughout the years and they have all become repeat customers.Real talk, if you're on yelp looking at this, you're clearly looking for a good barber.  Just call them up or come through, you found what you're looking for."
10/4/11,0.466666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Worth the trip. I drive from Playa del Rey to have my hair cut at Lincoln Barbers. Always a good cut with a smooth fade. These guys know what they are doing.
9/19/13,0.204268333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"First of all, before Lincoln Barbers i was having a difficult time finding the right location and the right barbers to fit my haircut needs.  From experiences that I've had, many barbers would get frustrated if I wanted a change in the look I was originally aiming towards; moreover, no haircut recommendations were ever given.  Nevertheless, Lincoln Barbers has not only met my standards they took customer service to a whole new level.  My dad and I always get a fresh and clean haircut by Steven, he is a outgoing and humble guy.   Although he has an ample amount of customers, Steven always accommodates us according to our schedules, leaving my dad and I happy and content.  In addition to getting a great looking haircut done exactly how i like it, i look for a comfortable and down to earth ambience.  Which is what this shop offers.  From sharing jokes with the fellas to receiving everyday life advice.  That being the case, all the barbers at the shop make you feel welcomed, and from what I've experienced they get each haircut done in a timely manner.  I've been a client of Lincoln Barbers for a couple of years now, and look forward to continue as a customer for years to come."
5/22/13,0.124791667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Very Professional. I have always had a good experience when i come here. Rafael(barber) has been cutting my hair for over 16 years. I can always count on him to give me a good haircut.The shop is very clean.The cost is a lot less than other barbers, If you make an appointment you are in and out in 30mins. I highly recommend this barber shop."
4/12/12,0.247252747,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Anyone that wants their fade to look right should come here... Period! I would give this place 10 stars if I could. I've had a fade cut for over twelve years and by far the best barber I've had in that time is Steven. He cuts upstairs on the second level, I totally recommend him for any hair style. I'm a manager for a very big company and I know quality when I see it. These guys get the job done, and do it right! Anyone that says any different is probably just trying to hate on this shop. Their prices are fair and the service is great. I wouldn't go anywhere else to get my haircut even it was free!"
11/25/12,0.422222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is unassuming barber shop is the best I've found yet--and that includes more than one spendy 'upscale' competitor.  Extremely careful with great attention to detail (perfectly symmetrical, even, and all that good stuff), and gave me precisely what I wanted for a mere $15.  I'll be back!"
10/27/11,0.344636364,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"The new, 2nd location that opened up next door to Bay Cities is great. Spacious and nice TV and all of the barbers are experienced. I highly recommend Dennis, who has cut my hair the last 3 times. He takes his time, listens to exactly what you want, and just seems like a good guy."
3/7/12,0.178409091,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been getting my hair cut by Rafael at Lincoln Barbers for 21 years now, and still remember the first shop he worked at on 17th street. No matter where in the world I am, NorCal, France, or Australia, I still come back every few months to get a fresh fade from him.  He's a barber you can really trust to do his best and give you a professional, clean cut. His new shop is next door to Bay Cities Italian Deli. Hard to find a better combination of a new haircut and a Godmother sandwich."
4/24/12,0.396806723,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"Let me say, this place is GREAT! Top notch! I just moved out from NYC to LA a few months ago and was looking for a good barbershop that I can get my monthly cut. After trying out some places, I can truly say that these guys are legit. If you want a Don Draper style cut, a fade, buzz, clean up, these guys do it all. I am very particular when it comes to choosing a barber, it's a relationship/friendship you end up cultivating for years once you find the RIGHT one. There's a reason why there's never an empty seat at this joint. All the barbers are good at what they do, courteous, and ACTUALLY listen to the customers. The store itself is very clean and sanitary. They def utilize good clippers and sanitize their utensils after each use. The place also boasts a flat screen so you can catch sports so it def feels like a good place to kick back and relax. Trust me, Chino the owner def has a good crew working for him there. ----Madhu"
