4/7/18,0.472820513,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This place is amazing! We were greeted immediately by Greg and he was so engaging and charismatic. Loved the feel of the place and the look. This place is super rad and the staff and customer service was even more rad! They are mostly appt only but we came in as a walk in to check it out and they made an exception and took my boyfriend as a walk in. Very professional and inviting and friendly. Service and experience was super awesome! Would recommend anyone and everyone to come here! :)

3/2/18,0.091666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,If you're looking for a quality cut this is the place to be. Mikes been cutting my hair since this place has opened and I'm NEVER disappointed. If I can give more stars I would.

Score!!!  then, they fixed his inadvertent mullet he was getting at a cheap chain establishment for years.  Two thumbs up from him and his happy GF!!"
2/6/18,-0.073660714,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"These guys are awesome and treat you right. I just moved away and I'm really sad about it, but while I went there, it was a pleasure. I'm a bit sad that they raised their prices quite a bit. Now we have guys paying the same girls pay for their cuts. I decided to let my hair grow just so I can save some money. Other than that, I'd be spending $70 a month on average on just cutting my hair."
2/3/18,0.45,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,They never disappoint. Cool environment and make you feel welcome. Book an appointment because they are busy. Thanks Bob for the great cuts
1/27/18,0.523611111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best barber shop in Orange County hands down. You pay for the quality and service and it is the best. I come here every 3 weeks to get cleaned up and will continue to do so. Thankful to have this barber shop so close to my house. Thanks Josh and Greg!
1/24/18,0.21875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I used to have a basic hair cut until I came to Harbor Barber.  Cool hip spot with lots of character.  Armando is the guy to ask for when getting your hair and beard trim.  Yes they trim beards. Need to make my appointment tomorrow!
1/9/18,0.35,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Amazing barbershop with amazing talented  barbers. Going for a Beard cut is scary but at harbor Barber they know beards as well as cuts

11/29/17,0.061111111,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"This barber is overall amazing, the style and vibes they give off. Unfortunately every place has an unreliable person. When someone makes an appointment for 9am and your barber says if you can be here early like 8:45 you better be their at 8:30 or they will give your 9am appointment away (I showed up at 8:50). Disappointed in you Mike, I though you'd be amazing because we share the same name. I'll be back to this barber shop just won't make an appointment with Mike."

Mike cuts my hair to perfection and the service is way above 5 stars! Definitely make a appointment get the shave and cut experience! Prices are reasonable fair and eat worth it! Don't be a jerk and make a appointment or be late. And if you are let them know. Awesome guys. All the guys that work there zack, Mike, Greg, Armando, and bob! Awesome peeps! Ask Greg about the back shave special!"
11/21/17,0.534722222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been coming here for almost 3 years now. Had cuts from basically everyone in the crew but Armando is my go to guy. Great cuts, and an even better atmosphere. It's hard to find a place where you don't have to watch what you say in fear of offending someone these days, but this place is one of them. All around good guys, good prices, and a great experience."
11/18/17,0.491666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I had a great experience here getting a beard trim with Armando. The barber shop itself is clean and the interior is cool. The waiting area is comfortable. There's easy, free parking and the location is on a main street.Armando did an excellent job trimming my beard. He was also fun to talk to and gave me a lot of pointers on maintaining my beard.The price for the trim was 15 before tip, and I think that's a fair price.  Will come again."
10/6/17,0.491666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Happy to say this place rocks! An old school joint where you can get a cut and shave with a beer in hand. Friendly service and family oriented as well. I'm so thankful to have a spot like this in my neighborhood.
9/29/17,0.347222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been looking for a barber since I moved to Huntington. It took me a few tries at other shops, but this place is great. Great atmosphere, fun and talented barbers, and a beer if you'd like.Bob is my guy - I'll go to him as long as I can. Very happy with the service here."
8/18/17,0.43125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Was visiting from out of town and stopped in not knowing what to expect, great place to go, I  was able to get an appointment same day and they did an amazing job. I didn't know exactly what I wanted so the barber took a few minutes to discuss options and made it turn out better than I've ever seen it before. Great pricing for the service they provide. I would recommend this place every time!"
8/4/17,0.057159091,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"These guys live up to their famed reputation! Customer service is extremely evident, they also offer you a beverage of your choice, and keep the banter going. These guys give you the advice you're seeking if you're not exactly sure what direction you want to go with your haircut, and their shop how's that old-school feel with a little bit of modern Flair. I highly recommend you go and see Bob or Uncle homeless"

7/12/17,0.310551948,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I wont get my haircut anywhere else as long as I live in Cali. All very friendly and welcoming, Mike does an amazing job, ive had my hair in many different styles and he makes it look better then I imagine everytime."
6/29/17,0.30125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This barber has been our go-to for the last year since we discovered it. Before this, I did not know a haircut could be this simple and timely. No matter how detailed or vague your request is, they will give you the cut you always dreamed you could have. And you can't write a review about this place without mentioning the straight-razor shave of the back of the neck and around the ears after your cut, topped off with some Bay Rum aftershave behind the ears, leaving you feeling like you just got out of a refreshing shower after getting your hair cut.On top of the high quality haircuts, the customer service is the best I have ever experienced at barbershop. They are all kind and readily engage in banter and lighthearted conversations and they take great care of you while you wait for your appointment. With this, they charge very reasonable prices for a quality cut and the many extras that come with it."
6/29/17,0.207027972,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been going to Harbor Barber every couple of weeks since the shop was fairly new and can't imagine going anywhere else now. Greg is my go to guy and I can honestly say I've never left with a haircut I wasn't completely stoked on. The atmosphere is really laid back, the entire staff is really friendly and funny while still very professional. I can't say enough about the quality of work and level of customer service this place produces. Thanks boys!Word to wise, make an appointment if you're trying to get in on evenings or weekends."
6/10/17,0.354285714,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"So this happened today... there is a first time for everything right? My fiancé has a good buzz right now, so it's funny. I can't promise what he will think tomorrow."
6/8/17,0.259487179,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I consider myself lucky. I am one of the very few people who was able to walk in to Harbor Barber and be there when somebody else canceled. I had the pleasure of working with Mike to create a clean, professional and cool style for my Colorado bearded style. With beer in hand and hot cloth on my neck it was easily the best haircut I have ever had. Don't miss making your reservation here. They are busy busy busy. I will be back."
6/8/17,-0.142727273,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Treated like crap. Too busy to care about service. 45 minutes to closing time. 4 barbers finishing up, 2 customers waiting. Sorry we're full. I have two boys that get cuts every two weeks, plus myself. Looking for a new spot, this won't be it"
6/5/17,0.592,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Armando is the best. This place never disappoints. Good people and you will always feel fresh. Highly recommended. Please keep up the great work.
5/27/17,0.32,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Fantastic barbershop! I come here whenever I am in the area. These guys really know their stuff and go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy the cut.
5/25/17,0.11882716,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,These guys are hands down the best. My husband get his haircut here every Saturday.  My ten year old comes in once a month.  Nothing like a relaxing environment and a nice cold refreshment while you wait.  All of the barbers are extremely skilled and friendly. You will not be disappointed.
5/17/17,0.354570707,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best place around to get a hair cut. Very good atmosphere and a chill place. I'm not far but I drive down from Long Beach. Mike cuts my hair every time and does a great job! He's pretty much becoming a friend and easy to hold a conversation with. Bob cut my hair a few times and did just as well but Mike cut my hair when I went in for the first time so I keep using him. USE THESE GUYS! You won't regret it
5/15/17,0.166319444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Hard to imagine giving Harbor Barber anything less than five stars!Where to begin? The shop has an awesome old-school feel to it, but not a whiff of artificiality - and a free beer with my cut? Yes please!The entire staff there is incredibly genuine and have great camaraderie  with each other, so you'll never feel out of place and always apart of the conversations swirling around you. And now for what you came here to read about, the cuts. Simply put: spectacular!Greg the Mortician and his crew take attention to detail to a whole other level while still being prompt with the duration of your haircut. Vague on what you're looking for? Don't worry, they'll decipher your request and bring your idea to life on your head.  Beard getting out of hand? Don't fret, they can trim it up to a level that would make Rip Van Winkle green with envy. And one of the best aspects of the entire experience at Harbor Barber?  The affordability of their services! Lots of places charge damn near double compared to Harbor Barber, yet fail to deliver the same level of quality. Cheers to Greg and the team, and thanks for many more great cuts in the future!"
4/29/17,0.45462963,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Went to the harbor barber for the first time today and it was awesome. I came to see if I could get a good haircut for my wedding next month and I will definitely be back before before the big day. Everyone was super nice and personable and made you feel welcome. Bob was my barber and gave me the best haircut I've ever had. He is awesome, laid back and did a great job on my hair and my beard. The attention to detail was top notch and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to get a great cut at a legit place. Thanks guys"
4/21/17,0.833333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,All the barbers at HB do an excellent job at a fair price.  I'm happy I found this place.

2/26/17,0.63,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I found out about Harbor Barber after passing by and checking out the reviews on yelp. Made an appointment today and picked the earliest which was with Zack. They were GREAT! I used to cut my own hair since the Marine Corps and always thought barbers were overrated but since I was going for a longer cut, I needed help. I'm glad I went here. I needed advise and Zack had answers. He was great. Even offered me a BEER This place was awesome. Zack was really cool and helpful. I appreciate the care he gave to detail on my cut. Even got a straight razor to my neck line and a warm towel. Good job guys! Keep it up! Thanks Zack!"
2/21/17,0.108333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"It's undeniable that the owner, Greg, takes pride in his trade.  Today, I made my first visit to Harbor Barber as a walk-in.  I was paired with him who welcomed me to his chair.Because I'm usually unsure about what style to ask for, barbers typically get annoyed (typically whip out an old picture).  Greg did something I never experienced:  He took time to push my hair around and actually think about it.  We came up with a good direction and he took over.They obviously care about their space.  The shop is a classic setup, but well executed. The interior is clean, masculine, tasteful, and comfortable.  Custom-made skateboard booster seats and water bowls imply a kid and dog-friendly atmosphere.  I almost felt under dressed because everyone else was elevated to such dapper-fashion levels. After a neck shave, hot towel, and some pomade, I was very happy with the end product.  He even brushed the hair off my shoe.Greg earned his 5 stars as well as a returning customer."
2/21/17,0.53375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,These guys are always awesome! I'm a female and they are always so inviting and friendly! I go in for side shaves and fades and they always come out great! Highly recommend!
1/27/17,0.102314815,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Came here for the first time today after not going for no apparent reason. It's down the street, barbers are down to earth, all skilled it seems, reasonably priced, and over all what I've been looking for."
1/25/17,0.35,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Everything was fantastic. The people were great and did a classy job...they were really intentional and took good care of what they were doing. I'm not a local, but this would be my go-to place if I was! Thanks guys!"
1/20/17,0.302002165,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I found this place shortly after they opened for business. Very happy I did!! Zack is undoubtedly the best barber I've ever had. Every time I get my hair cut I'm more impressed than the last time. Evidently, I'm not the only one who thinks so... it's getting hard to schedule an appt. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area or looking for a new barber. If you schedule though, please do everyone a favor and don't no-show. It's hard enough to get an appt these days and barbers this good don't deserve to be stood up!!"
1/20/17,0.408571429,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is fantastic, quality barbershop that I highly recommend. I got referred to zach by a friend that did a phenomenal job and a great dude. I'll definitely be coming back to this joint. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Keep up the great work boys!!"

1/11/17,0.302083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Just moved to the area, found these guys on Yelp and decided to give them a shot.  Called them up to make an appointment and Mike answered, he got me in within 45 minutes.  He went over how I normally do my hair and what would look good.  He took his time, cut it exceptionally well, and the cut came complete with straight razor, after shave, warm towel, and style.  Will definitely come back and would recommend."
1/7/17,0.161363636,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"These guys know their stuff. I decided to give them a shot and I was not disappointed.  ""Mondo"" was my guy.  He cut my hair to just the length I wanted and his cutting technique was expert.  The shop is classy, and they have a guy who is more or less a maitre d, taking reservations, keeping the shop clean, and offering free coffee.  Classy, old school, ""man's man"" kind of barber shop. I'll definitely be back."

Chill music and great overall experience."
11/28/16,0.1125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Love this Barber Shop. Always get a good cut and the Ive got solid hair cuts from almost every barber there. You wont be disappointed.
11/21/16,0.241750842,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Choosing a new barber shop is often something that gives me a lot of anxiety. Hair grows and a bad cut isn't the end of the world but it's still important to me that a shop delivers both on the cut itself as well as general atmosphere. Something I've been looking for more recently out of my barber shop experience is that the barbers keep things traditional without it being sterile (personality wise; obviously all equipment should be kept clean lol).This is exactly the sort of place I was looking for. It has a very tattoo shop vibe to it, which I love. There's lots of traditional style artwork and posters and I'm pretty sure every barber had some sort of visible piercing or tattoo. What's even better was how genuine and friendly everyone was. As someone who has worked in customer service for a long time, I can always sort of tell when a person is being nice because they have to be or if they're being nice because that's just the sort of person they are. There was never any question that everyone who worked there loved what they did and it definitely showed in their customer interactions.Bob cut my hair and gave me exactly what I was looking for. He was very accommodating and again, really friendly. I'm not a big talker but there wasn't really a point of awkward silence that you get with some barber shops if you don't talk enough with your barber. Overall, the cut looks awesome and I'm for sure going to make sure to make an appointment with Bob again next time."
10/20/16,0.486458333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,My first time at a barber and it was awesome! got my hair cut by mike and he did a fantastic job!! i will definitely be returning here from now on! Also the place inside is so cool. i love its classic feel and all the guys are awesome.
10/18/16,0.183111111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I finally got talked into going into Harbor Barber, and I am really friggin' happy that I did. I work in the same strip mall so I've know the guys for several weeks now, but since I'm bald and, for the most part, clean shaven, so I wasn't sure what they were going to do for me. Regardless, Zack scheduled me for a 3pm appointment last Sunday for a straight razor shave and it was hands down one of the best experiences I have ever had. I didn't realize that there was a way for a guy to sit in a chair while a bearded man takes a straight edge razor to your scalp but I was dead wrong. The first thing I took in was the quality and ambiance of the shop; it was clean, extremely comfortable, and the theme is unreal. These guys actually give a shit about their clients. Zack started off with a hotel towel, lotion, and oil. The shave was comfortable, and actually really informative, I learned a lot about the murder weapon being used to groom me. Long story short, do yourself a favor and go see these guys. It's worth the experience."
10/13/16,0.642857143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Awesome atomasphere, amazing haircut, and good conversation. Mike did an amazing job on my haircut today, and told me about how it all started. Overall a great experience, and a great haircut."

Based on the advice of everyone here, I made an appointment, even though I went on a Wednesday morning. Armando greeted me and was really friendly (I had never had a barber engage me in conversation like he did). For $20 plus a good tip (my hair was really long), I received a really nice haircut and some good styling advice. As others have said, the ambiance is awesome and they all have nicknames at the bottom of their mirrors. I will definitely be back."
9/6/16,0.24447314,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"WOW WOW WOW‼‼‼‼I am 31 Years old, I live 25 mins away from Harbor Barber. I have NEVER had my haircut done as well as Harbor Barbers ""GREG"" Did! It wasn't so much a Haircut as it was more of an Experience! From start to finish this experience was unlike any other in my life! As long as Harbor Barber is there I will ALWAYS go there for the same experience! A YELP review cannot do any aspect of justice as to what they offer, truly amazing and one of a kind! You want a Haircut then go see ""The Mortician"" GREG!!!! ‼"
8/27/16,0.208780109,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I am super particular about my haircuts. I have a clean slick back style that takes a steady hand and attention to detail.  I have been seen by both Greg and Zach and never been let down.  Every haircut ends with a straight shave on the neck and around the ears then some oils on the newly shaven skin followed by a hot towel after wards.  It's ~$20 for a $60 cut.  It's great to see a Barbershop that takes pride in their work.  I would suggest calling ahead and making an appointment if you come in on the weekends.They didn't ask for this review nor was I given anything for it.  Can't say enough good things about this shop.

6/25/16,0.190384615,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I'll be honest. I think Yelp is doing them a disservice by only allowing you to select 5 out of 6 or maybe 8 stars. Jesus not only got his hair cut here. He made the twelve disciples get a fresh cut before Leonardo Da Vinci could paint ""The Last Supper."" I read up on this historical event from Wikipedia, trust me it checks out. More recent facts are as follows; Bernie Sanders will pay for your haircuts on the fifth Friday of every month, Donald's hair style was made famous here, Mr. T pities the fool who lets any other barber cut their hair, and Justin Bieber is a frequent customer. Bottom line, It's a great... No, Fantastic Barber Shop."

I did a home buzz off of my long hair and needed it cleaned up and Armando was perfection. I will definitely come back for maintenance!!"
2/16/16,0.580952381,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,These guys are the best. Armando is the guy who cut my hair most of the time and he takes his time and knows how to cut it clean. I was happy to tip 30% for good haircut every 2 weeks. You won't find any clipper guards or anything. It gets kind of busy so I always made a reservation in the morning for an afternoon cut.

Love it.Just pay attention in the parking lot... I managed to drive over two concrete blocks on the way out because I'm an idiot. Absolutely a 5* experience and I'd recommend making an appointment to make sure you get seen. I've been looking for a good quality men's barber since I moved here from the UK and it looks like I've finally found one. Pricing is incredibly reasonable for the service and the products used seem to be of a great quality."
2/13/16,0.310416667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Second time at Harbor Barber. Both cuts by Armando. Love this place. Everyone is great and it looks like all the guys know their stuff. I'm really happy they have a consistent staff as my previous barber seemed to be a revolving door of cutters. This is a drive for me from Seal Beach but well worth it. Have a beer or a coffee while you wait. There's a couple of chairs out back if you need a smoke while you're waiting, too."

1/20/16,0.35327381,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is great! I've had my hair cut by Greg and Mike and both give great cuts. All of the barbers are funny, so there's never a dull moment inside the shop. There's nothing more awkward than getting a cut in complete silence while someone has a sharp object to your head. Believe me, this place is the opposite of that. The vibe and ambiance inside the shop is fun, so if you're having to wait a bit, eavesdrop on their conversations and I'm sure you'll be entertained. So if you're looking for a great place to get a cut, while engaging in good conversation, then this is your place. And did I mention they offer you beer!"
1/19/16,0.195614035,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"It is always nice to know that the person taking care of you is passionate about their craft. This shop is legit. Mike hooked me up with a classic cut and trimmed my beard while the dude next to me got what seemed to be the most relaxing straight razor shave ever. Beverages, skilled professional barbers, a clean shop full of character, great conversation and reasonable prices are clearly the recipe for building a client base. The staff (and other clients) were super friendly and welcoming. I will be back...regularly...but I will make an appointment next time, it's a busy shop and their attention to detail takes time."
1/17/16,0.249074074,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is a great spot to get a men's cut. The owner, Greg, has cut my hair 6 or 7 times now, and the experience has been consistently 5 stars. Even a crappy establishment can hit a home run on occasion; and solid places can totally whiff it from time to time. But when a service industry business delivers 5 stars, 7 visits in a row, you know they are deserving of all 5 stars. This place is nice, with a good vibe. The decor is equal parts old-timey barber shop, mid-century modern, and cozy log cabin. In other words, it doesn't try too hard to be anything, and so it succeeds in being its  own thing. Greg always asks what I want done, listens while I explain, and delivers exactly what I asked for. I've only had haircuts done, but from what I've observed, they are just as solid in their handling of beards. The cost for each of my cuts has been 20 bucks, and I consider that a value, considering their skills, the comfortable environment, and the fact that they always offer me a beer or a water."

All of the guys are top-notch though, I wouldn't hesitate to get my hair cut by any of them. Friendly environment, old-school feel. When I moved down here I went to about 4 or 5 other shops and most of them had a terrible, take it or leave it attitude... Not only are the guys at harbor barber great at what they do, they make you feel welcomed. **And when you're in here, ask Armando about the salmon special**"

11/23/15,0.466856061,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Perfect spot for no nonsense type of guys.   What does this mean, you ask?  No nonsense means you're a respectable guy who doesn't flake on their appointments, not here to hang out, watch sports, or be upsold with products.  You're here for a great cut for a reasonable price while enjoying a beverage (water/tea/coffee/beer), and these guys deliver.  Excellent hours of operation, super awesome barbers with fantastic attention to detail, good prices, and perfect location next to the beach with classy decor,  clean space and plenty of free parking. I've been here 4 times, each time cut by a different barber (they have 4 on staff, adding to 5 soon), and they are all seriously very competent without issue.Walk ins are welcome but I strongly suggest calling ahead to secure your spot, or just make an appointment.  There's no sense waiting in a walk in line 3 deep for a 25 minute haircut."
11/18/15,0.152251984,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I first met Armando at an Aerospace/Defense company we both worked at. I knew he cut hair and from my conversations with him was very passionate about it.Fast forward a year later. My old barber moved out of town and I had been jumping around from barber shop to barber shop. I just couldn't get a consistent haircut, as I was always getting different barbers. In addition, the shops I went to were not customer-centric. I walk in the door and they would pretend like I wasn't even there. Terrible customer service. These experiences pushed me to find a good barber and barber shop I can rely on. I remembered Armando and looked him up. This was almost 4 months ago and I've been a customer ever since. Armando does a great job with my hair. Everyone's hair, head, face is different and he tailors the haircut to suit those differences. Really great job!As far as the other barbers, while I've never had a cut from them, I can say that they place the same level of detail with their customers as Armando does with his. They won't stop until they get it right as far as what the customer wants. Plus they're all super cool and friendly. This is the only barber shop I've been to in this last year where they actually greet you when you walk in the door. Imagine that! They also offer you beer/drinks as you wait. In sum, I highly recommend Harbor Barber. Ask for Armando!"

All the barbers are very friendly and the shop is always so clean. Greg is my barber and he always does such a great job. It's  meticulous the way this guy cuts hair, truly a master of his craft, and he's only one in a line of four guys at any given time who all clearly know what they're doing. I would recommend this barber shop to anyone."

Harbor Barber is a classic barber shop that caters to Men that have a successful attitude.  You can see the pride that the owner takes in his shop, and the attention to detail that each of his employees deliver in their craft.  I would recommend this shop to anyone who wants a  great cut."
7/5/15,0.41537415,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great atmosphere. Barbers do great work. 20$ is a reasonable price for the effort and time put in. Can't afford 20$ every time for a cut with my budget, but certainly for important events, I'm making an appointment, in which j highly recommend doing so because they get booked quickly."

Besides the barber we wanted(Greg) was booked til 1. So we made an appointment for 1:30. And came back then. My son was so excited for his haircut he kept asking if it was time yet. When we came back in Mike asked if we wanted anything to drink(Water,Soda,Coffee) very friendly and hospitable. Greg came over and introduced himself after he was done with his previous cut. He asked what we were looking to get and I showed him two styles on my IPad. He was very understanding and very helpful. When it came to the haircut he did a great job and was kind to my son. This is one of those barber shops where you go to hang out with your buddies and bust each other's chops. The entire staff is friendly and do a great job with each customer they work with. I'll be back for more of my sons haircuts"

4/8/15,0.132916667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"There are a number of small barbershops in the long beach area that attempt to recapture that small town, american barber shop experience. But simply put, none of them measure up to this place. The interior is simple but elegant. The owner maintains a very clean and welcoming environment-- the establishment appears well managed. You'll no doubt be offered a beer, or even a coffee if you'd prefer. The barbers really do feel professional and they even  wear proper barber aprons (is that what they're called)? Price is quite reasonable and competitive with any shop in the south bay. And let me emphasize this point-- they SPEND TIME on your hair. Shout out to my personal barber at this joint: Armando. I've never been so impressed with a barber-- such time and attention. He really helped me find a style that works for my hair, and I always leave feeling like a million bucks.  I'll put it this way men, this joint sets the bar."

4/2/15,0.261739418,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is top notch. This is where all men need to go to get your hair cut. I didn't get the hair cut I came in for, I got a cut above that. I plan on going to Mike right before my next job interview just to get it right (I normally buzz #3 all over, not the best job interview cut). Go to this place once, I guarantee you'll like it and come back again. If you don't like a good manly conversation this isn't your place (it tones down when ladies or children come in, definitely family friendly)."
3/20/15,0.097258297,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Harbor Barber is a classy place and every barber that has been working while I get my haircut is treating their clients well. My barber, Jeff, recently moved over to this shop a few days a week. Although I live down the street from where he used to cut, it is worth the trip to Harbor Barber to get my haircut. A+ environment. A+ cuts. A+ service. Can't ask for much more."
3/9/15,0.254026375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"The main motivating factor that pushed me to try out Harbor Barber was the fact that my barber, Mike Lopez, began to work there after the original shop I visited closed down. I am happy that he manged to stay local to the Orange County area because it saves me a drive! Even if Mike hadn't remained local, I still would've have been more than willing to drive from Orange County to LA just to get a cut from the dude. Hell, I probably would've been willing to drive to San Diego to get a haircut from the guy. The reason why I would be willing to travel such great distances for a haircut is because Mike provides the best cuts. period. You can show this guy any picture or even toss an idea of the look you are going for and Mike can make it happen just as you envisioned it in your head. This guy is like the Picasso of hair! Either that or he is some sort of wizard conducting a new form of hair magic.If I haven't made it clear enough already, I highly recommend you check out Harbor Barber!"

However, this shop is so great I am compelled to review. I was originally going to the Parlor in Westminster before they abruptly shut down. The place is clean and very welcoming unlike most old school style barber shops. You're immediately greeted and offered water, coffee, or beer. It's a relatively new shop (only open 9 months according to the owner Greg). I suffer from Alopecia Areata (bald spots), so getting my hair cut is an anxious event. Greg is not only an excellent barber but an awesome dude. Very down to earth and outgoing. He listened very carefully to my condition and diligently cut my hair for 40 min. My combover turned out great and for only $20; but more importantly my bald spot ain't showing and my hair is lookin dope! Big boost to self confidence. I'll be a regular coming here now."

The shop seemed pretty dope, it had a nice environment, was offered a beer, and was greeted as soon as I walked in.My only gripe is that the barber (Justin) trimmed my hair  too short as I had asked for a light trim from the top. He mentioned that his old gig involved cutting a lot of military cuts. I'd avoid this guy in the future."

Grab a chair, have a beer and engage in some good conversations.Word to the wise, make an appointment and don't be ""that guy"" that decides he wants a shave when you didn't indicate at the beginning. A real shave is 30 minutes, so be cool and let them know.Harbor Barber is the only place I get my haircut now."

The best part is if there is a wait, the conversation is bright and uplifting and fun.  You feel welcome and Beyond that these boys are talented and know we exactly what they are doing.  The shop itself is clean and comfortable.  Again, very welcoming.

I was not at all surprised; as expected. The experience was all amazing! Greg knows his stuff and for a perfectionist like myself, I only had a big smile when I left. The old barber nostalgic experience is definitely ALIVE in Harbor Barber, down to the barber himself and his attire. I'm so excited to share Harbor Barber with my most finicky customers and friends. Oh yeah and the customer service; Greg will bend backwards for YOU! Since customer service is a dying experience in the US. It is so nice to walk into the Harbor Barber and feel like you are Royalty.

I go to Greg about once a week and always walk away stoked on his work.Harbor Barber is a clean and organized environment with good vibes all around. Unlike some of the other specialty barbers in town, there aren't any egos flying or prolonged wait times. Just a solid atmosphere with good company and quality work.Since I've started going to the shop I've had dozens of people comment on my cut. In fact my brother and father are now regulars at the shop. From little ones to old ones, i would recommend anyone to Greg and Jason.  Check 'em out!Side note: Their bathroom is really nice too.."

If you have never had a hot towel shave you should put that on your bucket list and give it a try with either Greg or Jason!

The interior looks fantastic and authentic. Really creates a relaxed and welcoming mood. I honestly really can't say enough good things about this barber shop and the two men that work there. Service was perfect, cut was great and affordable, shop was originally designed and practically pristine. I'll be returning and most certainly recommending to my friends and family."

They close at 6 but the owner was more then happy to accommodate me even though closing time was coming up.  Super clean and received an excellent cut.  I will be back for my next haircut for sure.
