11/4/17,0.296875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Jordan is fantastic. I showed him a picture of the look I was going for & he did it with perfection! I've just moved to the Bay area & have been here for a little over a month. Jordan is my barber from now on. Perfect fade & looks sharp.
3/4/17,0.633333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Good cut, best price, excellent service. I'm very happy to find this diamond in the rough. Don't bother with the glitzy barbershops. They're overpriced. ASK FOR JORDAN. He is fast and thorough."
3/26/17,0.20530303,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I recently moved to Millbrae after living in the East Bay my entire life and I thought finding a barber here would be a nightmare. Luckily I stumbled upon Fine Line while on Yelp and decided to give them a shot. I haven't looked back since, Jordan has been a true blessing. I have extremely sensitive skin around my neck/beard area which could get a bit difficult for barbers to cut through without causing irritation. Jordan takes his time with his craft and has great attention to detail which leaves me looking so fresh and so clean every time. Appreciate you Jordan!"
4/29/17,0.230208333,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"No frills locale barbershop, worth the trip from my area in San Mateo. Got probably one of my best fades since moving here from NY for a decent price compared to other cuts I've gotten. Got referred here by a friend and Nate hooked me up on a last minute phone call. Will most likely be coming back!"
1/29/17,0.537142857,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Good barbers, good service. I've tried so many barber shops in the city, and this is my favorite right now."
1/5/17,0.271428571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is a really cool spot. Really hard to find a barbershop that's affordable and does a great job. Far removed from all the yuppies in DT SF, which makes it even better. No $40.00 haircut here with a PBJ, just a straight up real barbershop that offers clean cuts. Jordan does a great job. Idk the other barber's name, but I've seen him do great work as well. Also open 7 days a week!! Hit this place up. Appointments only."
12/4/15,0.2,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Made an appointment 3 days before. I get there, and the barber is not there. Another guy walks in and turns out he's there at the same time for an appointment with the same barber.The barber double-booked us, and wasn't even there. It would be nice to have some bit of professionalism and customer respect."

9/1/15,0.1375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,A.D's been cutting my hair. Always does a great job. He's chill too. Killing it for a young guy in the barber game.I've officially found a barber who I can just sit in the chair and leave exactly how I was expecting my hair to be.
6/12/15,0.182616487,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I work in the woods and havent had a chance to post this review but I just wanted to say, this place is run and owned by some good and genuine people. This is a shout out to my barber Nelly. My first interaction with Nelly was actually on the phone. Even though he was booked with appointments and couldn't cut my hair he went out of the way to connect me with his old barber college in Daily City. He made sure I was in good hands and I had a fantastic cut from the barber college. Fast forward several months later, I had the privilege of seeing Nelly in person. He's professional, down to earth and I have so much respect for his art. The way he trims, his dedication and how he integrates his style was apparent in my cut. Now, my hair isn't easy. I got some thick Asian hair with two hair whorls but Nelly managed to do an excellent job event though we went over time. He's a great person to get to know, very approachable, and appreciated how much dedication he put into my hair. Cutting hair is not easy and Nelly did such a fantastic job with my crazy ass hair and couldn't have asked for anything more. Thank you so much Nelly, looking forward to seeing you again. Keep doing you and your art. Peace"
8/11/16,0.694444444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Be sure to hit up Jordan! He took his time and did a great job with my hair ! Would recommend this place to anyone looking to get a clean cut !
3/4/16,0.352272727,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My barber is Pete. Great guy, does great work really takes his time to make sure you are getting the cut you want. He will even give his recommendations based on how your hair is, give you advice or show you how to overcome some kind of hair issue. He is also an entertaining guy with personality and character. I feel like the barbershop would be dull without him. Pete still keeps it professional, always answers back when I text him about appointments. When you go to fine line ask for him first."
2/2/16,0.241666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Took me a while to find a good barber shop in the hood.  I finally found one.  There are others but Fineline is bar none.  Friendly and professional service.  Been coming here for a while now.  All the folks at FineLine are super legit.  Pete usually hooks me up with a nice fade and taper.  Austin and A.D. are there also and cut you up with the freshness.  These cats are always busy.  Better call and make an appointment.  Without one you'll be waiting a while.  The conversation, music and cuts here are always good, can't go wrong."
12/1/14,0.201315789,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I was in need of a last minute cut. Came in asked if they do walk ins and he said no but his earliest available appointment was at 4:00 and it was 12:00 so I said oh yeah I'd come back. He took my name and number and shook my hand. I was like wow very professional!Came back and he was ready. The seats are really comfortable! I was able to find out so much about the barber in only 50mins because that's how long it took. His name was Pete. Really friendly and great with clippers.I was expecting the cost to be like $25-30 but he said only $20 so it was reasonable.I would defiantly come back to Pete and the shop only because he really made me feel welcomed and comfortable.
7/26/15,0.7,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,No words can explain how awesome they cut hair. My barber pete has true craftsmanship when it comes to hair. He is good with scissors and sheers!!! Great guy and does a great haircut. I will be making him my permanent barber. Thanks pete!
2/26/16,0.391666667,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"Been comin to this barbershop for the past year or so and they havent disappoint. Shoutout to my man Pete Garcia for always hooking it up with a fresh ass cut. Great barber and even better person. Much respect to you and your team, y'all got a great thing going."
4/26/15,0.451234568,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Moved back to the bay area, and I was so glad I found Pete. I have never had my fades this good. When I leave Pete over at Fine Line I feel like El Gallo Negro from blood in blood out. Chala I say. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. So glad there's good people out there like him. His skills on the blades and his ability to make people comfortable in the chair are hands down the best!"
11/23/15,0.247727273,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best barber place I've been to so far. Pete was my barber and he gave me exactly what I was looking for. I could tell he put lots of time and effort into my cut. Definitely coming back again, my new go to barber."
9/11/15,-0.034722222,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,This place is legit. First time here and Pete hooked it up! Super chill dude that takes his time in cutting your hair!
6/14/12,0.277536323,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I took my 5 year old nephew here to get his very first Mohawk.. I gotta admit that I was a little skeptical because I've never been into a barbershop before so I didn't know exactly what to expect. So here are the top 3 reasons why I would definitely bring ALL my nephews back here to get a cut:#1 Customer Service! The barbers here were extremely friendly. We were greeted with a smile as soon as we walked in and they made sure that we were comfortable as we waited our turn. Then they told us exactly how long the wait was and they were right on schedule. I love that!      #2 Creativity! Mike listened to my idea of what I wanted my nephews hair to look like and he executed it. I wanted something simple and stylish at the same time. So he made a simple mohawk and added a little star to it. My nephew was sooo happy to look like a little rock star! #3 And this is very, very important to me... I loved the music that they played the whole time we were in the shop! It just brought out the mood. Imagine a sunny day in Daly City... When do we ever have that? Well today was one of those days and it was nice sitting in a barbershop for the first time, watching my nephew get this hair hooked up by Mike and listening to some jams that my kids can rock to as well.. My over all experience was great. I would definitely be coming back here if any more of my nephews need a clean cut. When my nephews parents saw the new look, they were soo excited as well. They said that the barber did a really great job (which made me very happy because they are extremely picky when it comes to their kids). Thanks Fine Line!"
2/27/16,-0.191666667,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"Since moving to west coast 2 years ago I never been disappointed with my haircut from FineLines or PETE I should say.  He keeps me fresh, lines always sharp, and he's a  dope ass person."
3/26/16,-0.090277778,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Never got to get a cut, I made an appointment the day before and the barber Pete cancelled on me a few hours before the appointment. Disappointed especially because I could have made an appointment somewhere else that would have took me but with the last minute cancel I had no time and everyone is booked up for Friday, so no cut for me. It's hard to find a good barber that's reliable"
4/29/15,0.405227273,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Wow, this place is great! Great people, great experience! Pete was my barber, and what a conversation we had!  He didn't smell really bad like the old guy who used to cut my hair and he was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable there. Also he's like a surgeon with those clippers, got my cut perfect..I'm a very satisfied customer and will be back again:)"
8/29/15,0.090462963,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is a dope spot to get cut up. I come here for high tops/comb overs w/ mid bald fades. Always clean looking fades. A.D. hooks it up with a mean comb over. Every barber is good at their own thing. Only take cash, which isn't always a bad thing. I definitely would recommend this place"
12/18/14,0.083304239,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"Okay first lets get the prices straight cause people aren't being specific. -Fade/Taper: $20-Scissor Cut: $15-Both?: $25This place shouldn't be listed under inexpensive cause it's right up there with other barber shops in price. Next, the place is really small. Basically the size of a bedroom and set up like one to. It has a cozy feeling, but at the same time feels cramped.I called and asked if they did walk-ins or appointments, and Peter was able to schedule me in the day I called, so that was great. I showed up on time and he sat me down and asked what I wanted. I got a bald mid-fade comb over, trimmed the top a little. Simple enough, and he cut it pretty good. Only took him about 40 minutes to finish everything, but the thing is, while he was cutting me he kept stopping to chat with another customer or barber or go move something or even watch the game, so that kinda worried me about the quality of the cut. After he was done, he wiped the sides and loose hair with some oil or something and told me it'd be $25. I was kinda shocked when he said that, cause other reviews said only $15-20 and even the board that listed the price of said haircuts didn't say anything about $25, plus the cut I got wasn't worth $25 in my opinion. I felt it was more like $20 and he was squeezing that extra $5 outta it. So that bothered me. Overall, this place does a good job for fades and such, but I wish it would list the prices correctly and the barbers weren't so distracted."
5/19/15,0.2425,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been coming here for nearly a year for my haircuts. Pete hooks it up with a mean cut and is always very punctual with my appointment time. I'm sure the rest of the Fine Line crew are just as dope. Mean fades, super laid back environment, great conversation. All for a dub. In Daly City, this is about as good as it gets."
7/12/15,0.335416667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,So I've been coming here since I moved to daly city now. Which is a little more then a year. Found this great barbershop on yelp and I'm glad I did. Pete has been cutting my hair from the start. And let me tell you he never dissapoints. Best Barber I've been to ever since I moved to the bay!! Call and make an appointment with pete. You won't be dissapointed!
10/3/14,0.535,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I recently moved to Daly City from LA and am happy that I was able to find a Barber shop with very talented barbers working there. I had the pleasure of getting my haircut by Pete Garcia who did an outstanding job and provided commendable customer service. If you ever find yourself at Fineline Barber Shop, make sure to ask for Pete Garcia."
1/14/15,0.320707071,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Pete is a killer when it comes to fades! I used to see him over at the Bay Area Hair Institute barber college in south city and I'm so glad he was able to find a home. I would always come to see him for mid bald undercut but I decided to try something new. Pete is great at listening and will check in with you any time he needs some guidance on your specific haircut and its a pretty good price for a solid fade. Oh and if you're into boxing or basketball at all, test this guys knowledge and I BET you'll want to stick around!"
12/9/14,0.2625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Got a haircut here for the first time a while back. Really great job. Will definitely get a cut here when I'm in the area.

9/19/14,0.5590625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I was referred to this barbershop by a friend who told me all the barbers are good. Fortunately I got my haircut by Pete. Pete offered me a delicious micro brewed IPA which I enjoyed throughout my haircut (never had that at a barbershop) He was very polite and can hold a great conversation not to mention the hair cut was amazing. I had the best service I've had at a barber shop with him. I'll be coming back soon! Thanks Pete!!!
7/8/15,-0.035544218,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"Brought my brother here to get a cut, he is in town from Alaska on military leave. We walked in and out of three barbers not one of them said a damn word to us. Nothing. Not a ""hello"" not a ""we will be right with u"" nothing. So that pissed me off. If ur running a professional establishment then you gotta at least know customer service should be on point. After a few people coming in and out I spoke up and said a few things, around the lines of "" so what's the procedure here? You guys take walk in's or only appointments? "" I was about to get on how nobody acknowledged us wen we walked in when one of the barbers finally spoke up and said he would take care of my brother. My brother really liked his cut. The cut was 100% clean and on point. It's just the customer service that was crap! If you guys can learn to acknowledge your clients and provide customer service that make people want to return then it's likely your Business will grow and flourish. Simple. Word of mouth goes a long way."

2/28/14,0.297685185,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"The best barber shop in the Bay!! These guys are at the top of the food chain when it comes to customer service and Barber Kevin is a man with the spirit of a CHAMPION... What I mean is, I believe that there are two main differences between an average person and a CHAMPION. An average person is motivated by material wealth and overt recognition, while a CHAMP is motivated by their inner passion and drive to be better today at what they do  than they were the days before! Kevin is driven to be his best! He is #1 when it comes to making you look and feel GREAT!I refuse to go anywhere else even if it means looking like Don King until I can get an appointment!!!"
3/16/12,0.237559524,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Went here for my 5 year old son to get a cut. He really isn't a fan of other people cutting his hair besides his daddy but his dad isn't a professional so I just had to take him to get a cleaner cut n a lining. I was very anxious on how he would act because I know how he gets when it comes to other people tryin to cut his hair. We walked in and the barbers politely greeted us and were very nice. One of the barbers seated my son and joked around with him to make him feel comfortable. It worked! My son sat there until he was finished...the cut came out perfect, with a very clean lining! As we were walking out the shop I asked my son if he liked his hair cut and he said, ""I love it mommy!"" We will definitely see them again soon!"

9/21/14,0.178125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Adrian (or AD), is legit. Attention to detail, will chat with you a bit if you like, and is a great barber at a great price. What else can you ask for? I made an appt sort of last minute, and I came in - and although I was seated a little passed my appt time, I understood because he was perfecting someone else's hair. I'd appreciate the same detail to my cut too. Overall, I'm coming back for sure. Professionalism is key, and I've been to other barbershops that aren't professional, or consistent. I think I may have found my barber."
7/24/15,0.126388889,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"Recently had my usual spot close down, looked this place up. Great cut. First time went here, Pete gave me a clean cut. Definitely coming back here."

Always have good conversation with Kevin and Austin so if you're looking for a nice cut, good music, and chill barbers at a solid price, not to mention ""Nice cut"" comments in the days following, this is the spot!"
6/11/14,0.373809524,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I scheduled an appointment a week before my haircut with Austin and when I got to the place he had just opened the shop. He took me in and went straight to cutting my hair. He asked me what kind of haircut I wanted and I told him and the finished product was great! We had conversations from here and there and his customer service was great. After the haircut he gave me his business card and also gave me 2 q-tips for my ears! Do you know anyone who does that?! Anyway, Fine Line barber shop will be my only barber shop."
10/27/13,0.339285714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This place has great barbers and music is always playing. I usually go to Austin for my cuts. He cuts pretty much every style you can think of and if your feeling ballsy he can suggest something different for you and he'll cut you up perfect everytime. Hit em up if you need a fresh one!
10/12/13,0.266666667,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"Needed a line up and fade while visiting from LA & found this place on yelp. Spoke to & met with Austin. He took me as a walk-in & did a great job.

I'm use to barbers just trying to just get me out for the next cut to get the most bang for their buck, but Pete took great care of me taking his time to make sure I was satisfied.  You can sure bet that I'll be back for more cuts in the future, thanks a lot Pete!"

I called to ask if they accepted walk-ins and Mike told me he just had a cancellation so he was able to take me last minute. He took his time cutting my hair and the end product was CLEAN. The barbers were friendly and the place was clean, it had a pretty chill vibe. I'll definitely come back!"

3/4/14,0.280952381,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Been going here for the past 4-5 haircuts and I'm never disappointed . Kevin is a beast he will hook u up with a fresh cut every single time and he's patient and never rushes . This barbershop is the best around and it's only $15. If you need a cut from here ask for Kevin but I'm sure the other 3-4 barbers are just as great.
12/30/14,-0.0375,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Looks like I have to write their 3rd negative review in 2 days. This was a complete waste of time. I phoned in at 10:56am and made arrangements for a 3pm appointment. I arrive a minute early, but thanks to the Daly shop being non-existant on google maps, I ended up at the SF location. I had no idea there were two locations - my bad! So I call the Daly City location at 3:02pm to let them know I am ten minutes away. The guy at the Daly City location tells me that he can't take me for another 45 minutes anyway. So I tell him I'll call him back in a minute. I asked the guys at the SF location if they could take me because the Daly city location weren't going to take me at my appointment time anyway. They said they are fully booked (fair enough) and then mention they gave up my slot because I did not show up! Keep in mind, I called them 2 minutes after my appointment time!  It's 3:05 now and I call the Daly city location back to tell them I'm coming in. Then they tell me they are fully booked and can't get to me till 7pm. I ask him about my 3pm appointment and he replied that he did not keep my slot open because I didn't call to tell him I was coming in for my appointment! I offered to take me at 2pm the following day. No thanks! I went home instead.  It is now 3:37 at the time of this post. What a waste of time. I can't speak on the quality of their hair cuts, but I can assure you they have no integrity."

The barbers, Derrick and JJ are on point with their craft in cutting hair. I was surprised to see they opened up another barbershop, because I heard a lot of good stuff about their other shop on San Jose Ave. To be honest I was little intimidated when I first came here. But really, just get to know them, and talk to the barbers. They're always generous and professional. Theres good music, good tv, good conversations, good people, and great cuts. I recommend getting an appointment because they never seem to be empty of customers unless they're closed."
