I was honestly surprised that I was able to get a same day appointment on a Saturday due to someone canceling their appointment.Jason was very detailed and thorough. During the straight razor shave, I didn't get one cut and I felt great afterwards. All throughout my wedding I kept getting complimented on my beard so this trip was well worth it.I don't go to barbers very often but I might just have to spoil myself more often now. Thanks again for the great experience :)"

I have mixed hair which can become an obstacle for some barbers.Jay gave me one of the best designed and most balanced haircuts I've ever had. He worked quick and efficiently.  I get my haircut once a week, and generally one of the biggest issues for me is the line up, but Jay's got me crisp and even."
11/7/16,0.477458333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I took my 1 year old son to The Cutlery for his very first haircut. John was so good with my son! He made sure to always check in with us about how we wanted my son's hair. He walked us through everything he was doing, which is great for parents experiencing the first-haircut stage! He let my son sit on my lap, which helped in keeping him still. Anytime my son would move or look at what was going on, John was quick to joke/play with him which made him more comfortable.Thanks, John!! Such a good experience. I highly recommend this shop."

Even after I moved to Daly City, I continued to drive 30 miles to Palo Alto to have my hair cut. I used to get it colored and cut, but then decided to embrace the gray and just go for a very short haircut. I learned, the hard way, that you either need really short hair or really long hair when you live on the coast. The humidity and wind will wreak havoc on anything in between. I started getting a mini flat top haircut, but decided that a 60 mile round trip probably wasn't necessary. It's not environmentally responsible. Surely, there are some decent barbers in the Daly City area. My first instinct was to go to Great Clips. After researching them on Yelp, I decided against it. Perusing nearby barbers, I found The Cutlery and its numerous 5 star reviews. I decided to give it a go.I called them at 11am and asked for an appointment the next day. I booked a haircut with Jose with ease. He confirmed my appointment over SMS the next day. I now have his cell phone number, so I can book future appointments via text messages.Make sure to make an appointment. If you read the reviews, the people with complaints showed up as walk ins and the barbers were too busy to accommodate them. The Cutlery is busy because they offer great hair cuts at a fair price. When I showed up for my appointment, it looked busy, but Jose said that it was actually a slow day!The actual hair cut is one of the best I have had in my life. My previous stylist was very good and had at least 30 years of experience. Jose is recent graduate of cosmetology school, and you wouldn't know it. He was precise and took great care to ensure that I had the perfect cut. He spent 30 minutes working on my mini flat top, and it was perfect. I actually let my hair grow for 4 months, and it looked horrible from the back. It took a little more effort to cut my hair and get it lined up and faded just right. He didn't rush the haircut at all, but instead strove for perfection.I also have to mention the vibe in this place. It's an urban barber shop, and not a salon. They have pictures of Tupac and Dr. Dre on the wall and hip hop music on the stereo. I really like the vibe. There's nothing pretentious about it, yet the barbers are consummate professionals.After my experience at The Cutlery, I've decided to become a regular customer. Jose gave me a perfect haircut at a reasonable price. They're within walking distance of my condo. I've lived here for 15 years and had no idea this place even existed. I just learned that I can get a perfect haircut for a great price just a few blocks from home."

I called in to make an appointment and got scheduled the next day with Darlene. She was super friendly and very helpful in making sure she knew what kind of cut I wanted to get. She showed me different pictures of different cuts to give me visuals and suggestions on what she thought I might like. When she was done, I got the exact cut that I had wanting to get for months. She did what other barbers at other locations couldn't do. This looks to be the consistent high level of skill and service that all of the barbers at the Cutlery Barber Shop have to offer. I will definitely be going back. Thanks again Darlene!!"

1/21/17,0.48,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Jay is an amazing guy.  He did a great job on my hair. He paid close attention to the hair cut. I can tell client satisfaction is very important to him. I never wrote a Yelp review but I felt compelled to review because of him. I would definitely go there again.

9/4/17,0.3875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been getting my haircut for almost a year at a bougie-ass salon near my school in Oakland that basically severs my limbs every time I hand them my credit card, where they don't specialize in fades as most of its patrons have hair longer than the style I sport. Decided to bite the bullet and go to a barber shop to get cut, instead! Best. Decision. Ever. I called the shop and a nice-sounding girl booked me to come in that day. This girl's name is Darlene and BOY BUDDY THIS CHICK KNOWS HOW TO CLIP! I have what is arguably the thickest, coarsest, most texturized Asian hair that could probably use a weed whacker most days. No problem for Darlene! Not only did we instantly hit it off chatting about makeup and hair, she suggested a bald fade and did a nice drop on it that was smooth af and looked slick as all hell honestly. The people of San Francisco take it upon themselves to verbally acknowledge just how fly my fade is (on the bus, bart, in the store, walking on the street, etc.) And the notion of going to a barber shop was very intimidating but as a woman I don't hesitate to brag about my barber being a *very talented* woman as well! GURRRL (and guys) trust me when I say Darlene is the ONE. Because I've come back for her and will continue to. Time and time again."
6/23/16,0.126427409,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been a loyal customer to this barbershop since they've opened and describe this shop as a professional, clean, and well capitalized business. I personally go to Kevin also known as Shorty (last chair to the left, near the restroom) and is a barber that cares for his craft and an expert in cutting hair. I personally get a taper and the hair cut is unmatched. He pays attention to detail in all aspects of my haircut from my line up, beard, and proper measurements for my taper. And is willing to go back if something is not up to your liking. The rest of the barbers in the shop are cool, outgoing, and very professional with their clients. From kids haircuts, comb overs, fades, designs, and classic hairs cuts, I've seen it all in this shop!! TIP: Make your appointments in advance to prevent any issues and to ensure a fresh cut when coming to the shop! Don't walk in expecting a cut without an appointment. 5 Stars for The Cutlery !!!"
8/6/16,0.208333333,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,They charged me $45 for an haircut. Combover fade. They basically rip me off. Haircut was decent and took 1hr and 35mins to be exact.
6/17/15,-0.015701129,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Worst fucking customer service ever. These folks are more concerned with leaving work prior to closing than servicing customers. The other reviews on this place seemed positive, so I decided to give this place a shot after work. Left work early to come out here, and sat down as a walk-in customer at 615pm. There were 4 guys still working and they looked about finished with all of their clients. Then one guy asks me, 'do you have an appointment?' No. I don't, but I came with the understanding that they take walk in customers. He said they did, but they couldn't take me, because they close soon (in 45 mins). He asked what kind of a cut I wanted, I explained, and it's a simple cut usually taking only 15 mins to do.  Instead, all 4 of them were concerned with going home early than admitting a new customer. I told them my situation - going out of town tomorrow and really hoped to have this done today - but, nope. These guys give no shits. While walking out, one of the guys handed me a business card. Please. I am never coming back here, don't even kid yourselves."

6/22/16,0.227272727,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Came in because I was in the area and needed a cut asap and I left knowing this is my new barber shop. Jason is the man he took his time and did an awesome job I'll definitely be coming back.
3/15/16,0.128571429,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been going to this barbershop exclusively for about 2 years now. I was skeptical at first but after the treatment I received the first time and ever subsequent time I have never been happier. Please make an appointment as they rarely have time for walkins. There is one review here from last year that grills them for denying a customer at 6:15pm and that his cut would only take 15 minutes; well for this place even the simplest of cuts they have taken their time and done the job right, making sure all the lines were straight. You go here for an experience not just an in and out in like 10 minutes sort of thing."
1/18/16,0.419191919,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Moved to the San Bruno area and was looking for a new barber. Ran across the good reviews here and stopped by. Was a bit worried as most of the customer images were showing guys with close cropped fades. I shouldn't have been. Had Kevin and the man is an expert. I showed him a pic (41.media.tumblr.com/b461…) and he cut my hair to look almost the same. He did a great fade (mixing scissors and clippers) and textured the top of my hair nicely. Really impressive work and he has a new customer going forward.One additional note--it's cash only
6/10/16,0.122222222,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Came in for a beard trim and was evident he was in way over his head.  Keep it long, he cut it short.   At leat it grew back quickly.     And thanks to the guys who tried to run me over out front"
5/21/15,0.474074074,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,It took me four months after moving to the bay to find a good barber. This place has premium quality barbers. My first time going in I had Kevin who was awesome. He spent the time to explain things about my hair I didn't even know my whole life. He gave me the best cut and fade I'd ever had. He's a true master of his craft. The quality of service here is outstanding and the place is spotless and clean.
8/12/13,0.325,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"Came in last minute for the boyfriend to get cut... thank you, Cutlery for taking him last minute.Although tucked in a plaza, the shop is clean, spacious with a family vibe to it.  If it's not flowing conversation about sneaks, catching up on life, it's the shop collectively listening to comedic rants on television or music while they're all being productive.  They're fair in price and clean on cuts.  Ownership seems particular on overall presentation and perception.  Personable and knowledgeable in both skill and customer service.If my father comes from Dixon, CA (about an hour and 15 minutes away) for his weekly cut, I'm sure to see my boyfriend making this his ""go to"" spot soon enough.  Thanks again, Jason.  Best to a flourishing business!"

When I went here it was a nice atmosphere and in a nice neighborhood. Jerome was friendly and gave me a nice cut. I highly recommend this place, will always come back every time I come back to the bay."
4/10/14,0.292916667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Really happy I came across this place. Jay cut my hair, took his time and was very meticulous in his work. I will most definitely come back. Also, prices were very reasonable and I got a discount for my first time. Super legit."
8/29/14,-0.08125,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,Never got the hair cut and trim due to the barber giving up my spot which I made the appointment three days in advance...I was told to call if things changed but the barber  took it upon himself to cancel my appointment...wow ...great costumer service...I was actually looking forward into getting a fresh cut but unfortunately I will take my business some where else you just lost a generous tipper...
12/18/14,0.4,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,Jason hooked me up with a great cut. He took the time to hear my thoughts on how i would like my hair to look. I will def be coming back for another hair cut soon
9/10/12,-0.008547009,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Well apparently if your a walk in your money is no good in this establishment. I walked in at 5:30 and they looked pretty busy, one of the guys told me that either him or his buddy could take me at 6:30 so i went and ran a couple errands, returned to the shop at 6:15-6:20 and sat down on the couch. When i sat down none of the ""barbers"" acknowledged i was there, at about 6:25 one of the 2 ""barbers"" that said they would take me at 6:30 just sat in his chair and watched the football game on the tv and didnt say a word to me. Then at 6:45 i had enough and just walked out. Long story short is i wasted about an hour and fifteen minutes waiting for someone to cut my hair and it never happened. Seemed like alot of irresponsible young kids trying to run a business. Good luck kids if this is the customer service you get at this establishment."
4/9/15,0.416666667,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,Just got a cut from Jason. He did a great job. The whole establishment is pretty clean.Really proffessional. I ddefinitely recommend.
11/11/14,0.361111111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I calłed the shop just to check if they have a slot for that day. And to my surprise, Mike, who answered the phone told me to come in the afternoon. The shop was clean and pretty busy. I looked for Mike and told him what style I wanted. After an hour, I looked at the haircut in the mirror and he f....g nailed it. This guy is a pro. His attention to detail was unbelievable. The haircut was what I have always wanted. Perfect haircut. Thank you, Mr. Mike. I'm sold!!! I'm now a fan of the Cutlery Barber Shop. Nobody touches my hair except this shop. Good job, Mike."
4/14/15,0.033491508,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"So here's the thing...this barbershop is either racist or there are no talented barbers employed there whose talented enough to cut African America males hair. I've been to this shop at least 5 times and every single time no luck. Then I thought to myself maybe I'm just going at the wrong time. So I've tried Tuesday morning, Saturday day, Wednesday morning, Friday night, just a bunch of various times...etc. and have not been able to get a cut. It's Tuesday at noon and a completely empty shop with one in the chair and one waiting, and you're booked. This isn't the first time I've gotten this response. Another time it was around 4 in the afternoon with guys getting cut in the chairs, and some barbers watching TV, and when ask if I could get an appointment, they would either say there done for the day, or was booked...but they were watching TV. I live in New York, I'm just in San Francisco for work! These ""barbers"" would never make it in NYC."
1/30/15,0.249950397,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I was in need of a hair cut but I was not about to go to supercuts, only to pay good money for them to mess my head up. So I did a yelp search for barbers. The Cutlery pulled up and was like down the road from where I lived. So I drove down to checkout the shop. Although it's best to set an appointment they were able to take me as a walk in.  The barber I got was Mike. Mike cut my hair, lined it up and gave me a shave. Got home and my wife approved of the cut I was given. Now if the wife approves I know I went to the right place to get a hair cut."
4/10/12,0.212161085,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This is a new place in Daly City that does cool fades and unique haircuts. The Place is located in a small shopping center that is not that far from the freeway(280) and always has free parking. I get my haircuts with Jason one of the owners. He takes his time and does not rush till he thinks its done. I know I have the best haircut when everyone notices. He has been cutting my hair for the last 2 years and im staying loyal. The new place has a big screen Tv that they play movies or have it on MTV for music videos. The place has a good vibe because the staff is funny. hints: To minimize wait time make sure you set up an appointment because they can book up on Fridays and sat because everyone wants to have a fresh cut for going out. prices are reasonable and remember to bring cash or else there is a ATM inside 7 Eleven.
11/20/13,0.294444444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"can't be any happier with my cut tonight by Jerome ..1st time at the cutlery and i can't complain walked out a happy customer chill vibe, guys are funny, made me feel comfortable.. overall LEGIT.. definitely made an appointment to return next week .. I highly recommend! Big ups again to #mrcutandburn !! =D"
11/7/13,0.279318182,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,So I just got cut up for the first time here today. I've been to many barber shops and this spot was probably the best. The environment was good. Jay cut my hair and he actually took his time (some places I've been to just rush it) and we chopped it up about sports and random stuff. He was very tedious about my hair. I must say probably gave me the best faux hawk I've gotten yet and he doesn't even specialize in that. That being said I highly recommend this place to any dude that's tryna look fresh. Oh and I didn't even know there was a first timer discount and Jay automatically gave it to me without me asking or knowing about it so that shows you honesty!
7/24/13,0.39681509,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Came in here today for my first haircut at this place and Kevin did an awesome job. He took his time to do the job right and it showed. Very fresh and clean cut and my hair and beard look the best they ever have. Well worth the money and highly recommended. This is definitely my new go to place. All the guys there were real down to earth and the leather couches and big screen TV are nice for relaxing if you need to wait. Call in advance because this place is popular, for good reason."
7/10/13,0.382792208,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Its hard for me to find a good barber that can do a fade right, but I lucked out and found one in the first try. Kevin is great and the place is nice and clean with a big tv. Price was perfect and will for sure be going back. The one star views (2) are odiously by people who do not yelp and are clueless."
3/5/12,0.353194444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is pretty awesome. The barbers there clearly care about their work, and they spend a lot of time on each person. They are very attentive to detail and the shop is really clean and has a good, friendly atmosphere. It was a little more than I wanted to spend on a haircut, but compared to Supercuts, which is the same price, it was definitely worth it. Definitely good at fades, and they offer to clean up facial hair as well. Be prepared to spend a decent amount of time there, though.I went during the middle of Friday, around 11 or 12 and there wasn't much of a wait, but they said it would be best to call a day in advance for a weekend haircut"
8/17/12,0.2335,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Highly recommend this place. All of the barbers are experienced and really enjoy their craft. They take the extra time and care that you simply don't see with other barbers in the area. They acknowledge the customers' needs and their attention to detail is a truly exclusive quality here. The atmosphere is very welcoming as well with minimal wait times. My barber is Mike and he makes sure I always leave satisfied.
1/29/13,0.197777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been all over the city at various barbershops/salons, looking for someone that could give me a decent fade and listen to what I want (I can be pretty particular when it comes to my hair), but I haven't been as satisfied anywhere as I was with Mike at the Cutlery.  Mike knew exactly what I wanted and I could tell he was confident in his skills. I would definitely go back to the Cutlery -- in fact, I plan on making an appointment for this week. Totally worth the 12 mile drive down to Daly City."
12/31/12,0.083184524,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Hellla sick place! They give you clean cuts and the barbers are chill af. M\y personal barber is Kevin (Not Shorty), the other Kevin. He gives you clean cuts and his prices are really good. He def. knows what hes doing, and hes a pretty chill guy to talk to as well. Will defiantly be back!"
