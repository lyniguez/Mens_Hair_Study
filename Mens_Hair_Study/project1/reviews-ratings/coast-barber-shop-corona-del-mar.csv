I had no qualms at all, especially when I found out early that he'd been cutting hair almost as long as I've been alive. (I'm 59 today.) He did a great job. He didn't need to ask me what size clipper I want, as they ask me every time at Sports Clips. Eddie is the consummate professional. Did a fine job on back of my neck. And he made me smile when he said, ""don't sneeze"" before he started to clip my nose hairs. Although it's going to be a bit of a hike to return, I'm probably going to start making it my regular place."
8/29/17,0.375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Been going here for four years and I won't go anywhere else. All three of them cut hair just the way you want it. Insider tip: go at 11am when Wendy is on. That usually brings out the best banter.

Fast Eddie has been around for years, so I thought he could do the job - clearly I was WRONG! My son wears his hair all one length and long and wanted to get a good trim (about 3"") Eddie cut his hair off up over his shoulders (in the back), and did a hatchet job so uneven above his ears on the sides that he looks like a Pageboy! Wtf! His first cut he showed my son and he said yes - that's a good length, but Eddie preceded to cut way beyond and a completely different style than what was requested! Thank goodness hair grows back - but unfortunately my son will be wearing a beanie until it is grown out! Awful! Eddie clearly needs to retire!"
12/24/14,0.15085034,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Fast Eddie and Angel have been my only barber for many years and I love the hair cuts and the whole feeling of the place. Yes, the hours are limited and most of the time you may have to wait a little. Fast Eddie and Angel have a life outside of the Barber Shop, they work long hard hours. Remember just because you show up at closing time that is no reason that the Barber has to work longer hours. Show a little respect for Artisan and work with them and you will receive a Great haircut!1/4 & 1/8"
11/24/15,1,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best Guys around. They get to know you and make getting a haircut a thing to look forward to.

Totally rude and thinks incoming back? Screw them and their lousy customer service."
11/6/15,0.475,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Quality mens haircut and a good price.   Great vibe with fast Eddie and crew and your just might learn some history about CDM.  Fast Eddie was the barber at the Ford Plant that used to sit where One Ford Road is between jamboree, MacArthur, bison and Bonita Canyon/ford Road."

6/20/16,-0.106666667,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,First time going there.  Long wait.  Very poor haircut - had to find another barber to fix it within two weeks.

2/14/14,0.18,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Just left Fast Eddie's...What a great find! Wish I would have found them 13 years ago when I moved here, but I will be using Eddie and his crew for at least the next 13 years."
2/17/14,0.65,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great place for men's haircuts with lots of laughs, great haircuts and a ton of local history in beautiful Corona del Mar CA.  I look forward to going every time!"
10/25/13,-0.247222222,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,Cool place. Horrible hours. Their hours 'claim' to be open till 4pm but they close at 3pm...  ON A FRIDAY! Seriously they only cater to the lifestyles of the retired and oc suit and tie wearing groups. Fail.
7/25/12,0.204166667,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"Exactly what you would expect from an old school barber shop. Fast service, good hair cuts, cool stories, and great prices. And a few playboy magazines.Met Angel for the first time today, I left with exactly the cut I was expecting and will be returning for sure. No salon bs, just dudes cutting hair!"
3/3/13,0.378787879,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Angel and Eddie are two of the greatest barbers that have ever lived.  The michael jordan and scottie pippen of hair cuts.  If you live in Newport/CDM and you consider yourself a man- you should only be going to Coast Barbers.
7/11/14,0.38125,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I have been going to this barber shop since 1990 when I first moved into the neighborhood.  Eddie, Angel and Daniel provide a friendly atmosphere and give great haircuts in an old fashioned barbershop.   I am still waiting for the Brazilian wax, though.Never retire, Eddie."
9/4/13,0.475,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"""I have been going to Eddie since I was 12 years old. I am 45 now and drive an hour to get my haircut. Eddie, Angel and all his barbers are great. Both my boys had their first cuts there. Old school haircuts, great value and always a great time."""
12/30/13,0.566666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best bargain in the county for the quality of the haircut.  You will not find better barbers than Fast Eddie or Angel in a 10-mile radius.
