I needed a last minute haircut before I left town to vacation with my girlfriend - Fernando said: ""no problem, come on down now!"" Mr. Soto's new shop (only 2 months old) is spacious, comforting, and rustic. I got a stellar haircut and Fernando finished it off with warm shaving cream and straight razor; fresh. Fernando, you've earned a loyal customer. Thank you!"

My friends and I have been going to him for several years, ever since he was at Lincoln's (which is also great). Soto treats all of his clients with the utmost respect, and his attention to detail is second to none. Plus, you can't beat his prices (be sure to get the $2 rinse and shampoo, it's well worth it)! I highly recommend Soto's to anyone looking for a great haircut in the LA-area!"

He's also given shaves and haircuts to all three of my sons. He is THE BEST (El Mejor!).  Nobody cares more about their craft and their customers than Fernando. Nobody has the breadth of experience and skills as Fernando.  He's got a winning personality and I couldn't be happier that he finally has his own place. If you're looking for a quality haircut or shave in Santa Monica for a VERY reasonable price - look NO further.  Soto Barber Shop is the place for you!!

The haircut was far superior than other competitors' haircuts I had tried in Santa Monica and Westwood. The atmosphere is very clean and relaxed. They also have complimentary water and coffee! I'm glad I finally found my shop.

I haven't had to worry about a haircut since. Does a consistently great job every time and is also 'good people'. Call for appt, he always accommodates w my schedules. Happy he has his own place now, he's earned it."

He is the nicest guy.  Always cheerful, helpful and glad to see you.  Fernando takes his time and  does a neat, careful and professional job.  My hair is easy cut however I have always been happy with the work he has done.  The shop is in the corner of a strip mall a few homeless hanging around but nothing too difficult to navigate.  Fernando is even paying one of these unfortunates to sweep the sidewalk in front once in a while."

The place is nice, the haircut was a fair price and the attention to detail was excellent. I highly would recommend this place. Since the first visit I have his # and get an appointment for cuts. No wait time with appointments, excellent consistency. I'll go to Fernando Soto for my haircuts from now on."
