4/8/18,0.133697872,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"When I saw the reviews of this place, I could not believe it. 109 of the 112 reviews were 5 stars. I have never seen any business with this degree of consistently high ratings. In spite of thinking the numbers may be artificially inflated, I decided to set up an appointment. Unfortunately, I reached Mike when he was celebrating Easter, but he was courteous enough to text back telling me that he was with family and that I should reach out in a couple days when he is back in town. Mike is the best barber I have been to. Instead of seating you down and cutting your hair, he will explain what he is doing and why he is doing it. He is very crafty with his tools and knows how to fully utilize them for delivering the best cut. He also adds a personal touch to doing business, which made me feel very special. He told me how he had a different Amit in his contacts and had to save my number as Amit 2. He is the first barber who saved my contact number! Mike recently moved from Santa Monica to a new location on Westwood Blvd. I have submitted an address update request to Yelp. If you still see the Santa Monica address, drop him a line to get his new address. He is very responsive to texts."

And I'm also sending a few of my friends they said they liked my hair as well. Thank you so much will see you again in a few Weeks"
2/23/18,0.404375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Happy to meet Mike! I have been living in LA for 3 years and I hadn't found a good barber, I was constantly changing barbers until I met Mike. I have been having my hair cut by Mike for more than a year and I think that he is the best in LA. The second shop is in a great location (Westwood) and much closer to my place. You should definitely try this experience and I guarantee you will stop going to other shops!"
2/19/17,0.126010101,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Go see Mike.If you want your hair cut properly, go see Mike. He's a master of his craft and clearly loves what he does. This guy has his own private room within another barber shop, and it's decorated to look like an auto shop. As soon as I sat down Mike started figuring out a plan to fix the way my hair had been cut in the past and he got to work with nothing but scissors (and little bit of trimming at the end to clean up the edges). Mike did an amazing job with my hair, but he may want to cut everything a little on the shorter side, so just be sure to communicate what you want and you're set."
6/17/17,0.186363636,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"You don't know how a real barber supposed to give you a real haircut, until you try Mike.I've been bouncing from barber to stylist, back to barber and so on. Some move, some don't care, some rush through it, etc. The minute I think I found just the guy/gal, only a week or so later, I  realize that I am not fully satisfied the way my hair start growing out, losing intended form and few weeks later I feel like I need a haircut again.Mike put a stop to that. He is a true Pro and a master of his craft, which translates in to a great haircut every time for well over a year now.Mike, thank you so much."
11/28/17,0.142857143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"When I first came here 9 months ago Mike and I agreed that my haircut was pretty laughable. He assured me that after each cut it would get better and better - and so it has. Will be recommending him to my friends. Look for Mike's private room at the back of Service Stations barbers, you won't regret it."
11/22/17,0.446666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is the man! The attention to detail that he dedicates to your haircut is unparallel. Always easy to book through, great conversation, and you always leave with the best haircut. On top of that, I've always received an absurd amount of compliments in the days after a haircut from Mike. Pimpin'"
11/3/17,0.367045455,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is the absolute best, he's accommodating, always pulls through when you need it most. And he went above and beyond for me just so that I made it to my New Years prty looking fresh. He is worth every penny, and I pay him gladly each time. Don't think twice just try him out and I bet you you won't find anybody else like him or with his skill set."
4/15/17,0.403125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I found Mike through a friend's recommendation. He's funny and takes a lot of pride in his work! He does a great fade and finishes off with scissors. Enter through the alley and park in back. Also cash preferred :) Prices raised to $40 per cut.
2/14/17,0.159126984,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been going to Mike's for about 2 years: Absolutely great service and terrific haircuts.  If it's your first time, it helps tremendously to chat with him and figure out exactly what you want before he gets to work.  He takes a lot of pride in his craft and it shows every single time I've gone to his shop.For logistics: the larger building can be confusing so go to the back of the space (or park in the back parking lot).  Mike's space is unique but very well laid-out.  Like any small business, it helps to be considerate and pay with cash if possible.I am not a fan of salons or spas so please note that you are there for a great cut and not for the standard salon experience (whatever that may be)."
7/18/17,0.270227273,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This review is for Mike, who has a little room in the way back of the shop. I highly recommend his services. He gave me the best, most long-lasting cut I've had in a while. He cares so, so much about his work and it shows in the results. He could charge 5x as much and it would be worth it. I only wish I could fly out for regular cuts."
12/30/17,0.284259259,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Excellent haircut! Mike's experience is evident in the way he quickly identifies problems with your hair and gives you a haircut that fits you personally and isn't just a standardized haircut. Also, if you are military, police or any other profession that requires a close fade, he did an excellent job on mine. I've never had someone pay such close attention to detail on my hair. Highly recommend!"
11/25/17,0.275,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike is an absolutely awesome barber. His attention to detail is beyond any other barber I've ever had cut my hair. The absolute best at a reasonable price. My hair cuts last three times as long as past barbers and feel way better.
7/2/16,0.55,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Ninja Mike is my man.He rocks the Hattori Hanzo shears like a badass.Mike has been cutting my hair for years and it is always perfect. He exceeds expectations and I walk out looking great ... every time.Best barber in LA. The best.
1/15/17,-0.051461988,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike has been cutting my hair for the last 3 years now and he is hands down one of the top 2 barbers i've know in LA imo (the other is Joe Bruno) and i totally agree that Colin C's review is just not true. You'll know a bad barber when he starts to cut your hair the moment you sit down on that chair and not even check out your previous cut. Mike will comb you hair first and follow the guide of how you had your cut before he starts using those scissors. Some barber shops yeah, they will charge $25 but after 2 weeks you pretty much had to back to them since your hair is already growing bad and messed up and i used to do that when i was going at a barber shop near Pico and Cloverfield i'm not gonna mention them out of respect. Ever since i saw Mike's reviews and Yelp and tried him, i only go back to get a haircut after 6 weeks or sometimes after 2 months cause my hair grows better."
8/17/16,0.065695273,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"After reading numerous positive reviews on Yelp, I finally decided to check out Service Station Barbers. Mike comes highly regarded among his clientele. Initially, it was a bizarre experience. I couldn't find his shop because it's located in the back of another barber shop which he has no affiliation with. I thought I was in the wrong place until someone from the other barber shop (Berkeley Barbers) kindly ushered me to the back. The space in which he works in is about the size of a walk-in closet. It has an auto-mechanic theme and is decorated with motorcycle gear. Mike himself is nice guy. Very laid-back and easy-going. He kinda reminded me of Tommy Chong (if you know what I mean). Throughout my haircut he constantly reminded me how cool it was going to look and psychologically made me think I was getting the best haircut of my life. To my disappointment, he was wrong. I showed him of a photo of what I wanted it to look like but he cut it drastically shorter than what I expected. It did not resemble the photo in any way. At this point there was not much I could do except pay the man. I asked him what the damage was to which he responded ""$40."" I looked at him as if he was joking but he was dead serious. I was surprised because numerous people on yelp quoted a men's haircut at $25. Since I was a first time customer I'm still curious if he actually gave me the correct price. In the end, I felt like I had been gypped. However, it was my fault that I didn't ask how much the cut would be. It certainly wasn't worth $40. For that price you can go to a professional salon with a much better atmosphere, get your hair shampooed and conditioned, and receive a warm face towel and neck massage. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here."
6/3/17,0.268055556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is the best barber I have been to! His haircuts are incredible! I have thin hair that is hard to blend and finding a barber that can handle it has been difficult. Mike has changed my notion of what a great haircut is. Mike can do it all from scissor cuts to fades to tapers. Trust me, a haircut from Mike will elevate your life."
12/25/16,0.504444444,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,I would say this place is the best place I've ever gotten in Santa Monica. I found this place by searching through yelp. Nice and Clean with professional service.Very happy with Service Station Barbers  and I highly RECOMMEND it.
3/11/17,0.522222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been seeing Mike for several years now.  He is by far the best barber I've ever had.  He's highly skilled in any kind of cut and always works to perfection.  I'm able to go more than a month without a cut from him and my hair still holds shape perfectly.  He's a master of his craft and loves what he does.  I've now moved away from Santa Monica and still insist on crossing town to see him. There's no one better than him.
8/26/16,0.538333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is awesome, professional and immediately I noticed he takes pride in his craft. He is exactly what I hoped for in a barber. Great work, reliable, affordable and extremely easy going!Thanks Mike!"
6/20/16,0.0375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been getting my hair cut by Mike for almost three years now. This guy has two passions in life: Cutting hair and riding bikes. You can see this reflected in the set up of his mechanic/tool-shop themed space (hence the name). Each haircut has lasted me 1.5 to 2 months and all have grown in incredibly well. Pay Mike a visit and he will show you that not all haircuts are created equal. Definitely reach out to him via text or call first to set up an appointment. He's located in a separated room in the back of Berkeley Barbers. You can find an entrance to parking in the back on Harvard St. The lot is small but I've never had any problems.
11/22/16,0.033333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,The best haircut I've ever had!Colin C. Is a complete moron.  9 out of his 10 reviews are one Star!
4/5/17,0.379166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike has been cutting my hair for the past year and I can honestly say that my hair has never looked better! Mike is incredibly detail oriented and you can tell that he takes great pride in his haircuts. Would recommend Mike to anyone!
4/5/17,0.5,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is the absolute best...I wouldn't trust anyone else.  He listens, cares, and, most importantly, gives an amazing haircut.  His passion for what he does is obvious and it shows in the cut you receive.  He never rushes and will make sure your hair is perfect before you walk out the door.  He's also a great guy.  I could not recommend anyone more."
11/28/15,0.259259259,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"The guy cuts great hair but his customer service needs work. I texted him for a last minute appointment at 11:35 am. He tells me to get there by noon. I respond saying I can't get there that quick and need 12:15 at the earliest. His response ""ok."" At 12:12 he starts texting me all this passive aggressive bs about missing the appt. I reply saying I thought we were on for  12:15. He says no, noon. A simple miscommunication but he treats it like I'm responsible for a missed appointment. Stay on this guy's good side is the moral of the story."
4/5/17,0.177777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike takes cutting hair seriously, and gives seriously good cuts. Fade, scissors he can do it all. I have tricky curly hair and I've had my share of iffy haircuts over the years. Mike is by far the best I've had in LA. Highly recommend!"
10/3/16,0.466111111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,A very talented barber at very reasonable prices.  Mike is good at all types of cuts and is a wizard with scissor cuts!  He is like an artist that views each cut as an individual because he takes into account what type of hair you have and how it grows.  When I first went to see him years ago he was the first barber that cut my hair the way it grows so that the cut lasts and grows in naturally.  He takes his time and does a great job.Great barber and nice guy too!
11/5/15,0.75,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike is the best! My haircut holds its shape for 8 weeks after he cuts it. Can't recommend him more if you're looking for a thorough all-scissor haircut in Santa Monica.
8/2/15,0.377777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike makes sure that your hair not only looks great once you leave, but he purposely cuts it so that it looks great for weeks afterwards. He's very polite, enthusiastic about what he does, and will not rush anything. Every review here is 5 stars - when was the last time you saw that?You're wasting your time and probably paying a lot more anywhere else. Make an appointment, park in the back, and trust Mike do the rest."
8/10/16,0.49375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I only go to Mike. He gives the best haircuts I've ever had and I trust him more than I trust myself. Truly amazing Barber. This may sound corny but I'd say he's more like an artist. The best part is that every cut lasts really long so I end up saving money when I see him.
3/8/17,-0.01,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"There's a reason this place has a 5 star rating. Michael is the real deal. I've been coming here for over a year and cut after cut is done to perfection. Michael is meticulous in the cutting of hair. Every haircut is done with a really high quality. He's also very cordial. Once you come to this place, you won't be going anywhere else."
1/4/14,0.282716049,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"If you found this yelp page, congratulations.  I search ""service station"" and all I get is ARCO.So let me narrate you through this.  You walk into Berkeley Barbers, head down, trying not to make eye contact, and you hurry to the back.  In the back is Mike, a combination of a biker/mechanic/hippie who knows his way around a pair of shears.  He is damn confident he's giving you the best cut of your life, and with reason.  I've been here three times and it's been really excellent, really careful jobs.  He gives you styling tips, keeps track of the cuts he gave you before and is all about building his business.Yeah, the only downside is you have to walk through one store to get to the store you want to go to.  It's like as if you were dating your ex-girlfriend's roommate.  But the roommate is so worth it."
3/10/17,0.3,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike does a solid cut, consistently.  Grows out well, so it lasts.  Nice guy, and the shop is cool."
7/1/16,0.2,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Got a fantastic cut by Mike. Can definitely tell he takes a lot of pride in his work. Would absolutely recommend him.
6/10/15,0.277083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike takes his time and it really shows in the final results. I've never had a barber show his enthusiasm for giving you the best haircut your hair can possibly receive.Even after several weeks, my hair grew into what I wanted, unlike most of the barbers from the past who's cuts would turn into nightmares living on my head after a couple weeks.The atmosphere is unique, it feels like you're getting your car worked on. Clippers hang from the ceiling, trimmed hair is removed with compressed air. My experience was incredible. Keep in mind that Mike runs his own gig in a private studio in the back and his studio has just one chair, ignore the unaffiliated barbers in the front."
5/17/15,0.225669643,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike is the best hair stylist I've ever had. I've been going to him for the past 6 months or so. I've tried many barbershops around the area but no one is even close to his level. And you feel comfortable with him as a person what I can't say the same about some other stylists I've tried before.I have thick and stiff hair which grows unevenly and Mike is the only person so far who could consistently deliver a great look. He knows and understands how hair grows and he aims to make your hair look great many weeks after the cut. A true PRO.
1/8/17,0.393395493,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,There is a reason why Mike has so many amazing reviews...because he is fantastic at what he does. He is truly a barbershop craftsman. This was the best haircut I have ever received and it was all because of Mike's focus and meticulous attention to every detail down to individual hairs that were not being cooperative. I have never had someone truly assess the state of my haircuts over the years and quickly give perfect guidance and advice on how to shape my haircut....and then execute on that plan perfectly. I can't wait to go back when it's time for the next trim. If you don't live in West LA he is worth the drive.
12/6/16,0.566666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is a pro. He listens to what you want, he's careful and meticulous, and he takes pride in his work. He gave me the best scissor cut I have had, and now I won't go anywhere else. Go see Mike if you want a great haircut."
12/16/16,0.408630952,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've lived in NYC, Philadelphia, and have always gone (for years!) to the ""top"" hair salons in NYC-- guys who do the fashion shows in NYC and around the world. Over 100 bucks per haircut. Was turned on to Mike six months ago and SERIOUSLY, this guy BLOWS THEM ALL AWAY! Not only has every cut been perfect, fashionable and exactly right for my hair and shape of my face, but when they grow in they still look great- i can go for weeks without having to get another haircut. Amazing. None better."
7/17/15,0.264378882,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been bouncing around to various ""upscale"" salons for a number of years and have yet to find anyone that consistently gives me a great haircut.  I've been told that my hair is difficult to cut (very straight with lots of cowlicks) and so most are very timid and don't have the confidence/skills to cut it right.  This was until I found Mike...I can honestly say that he gave me the best haircut I've had in years, for a very fair price.  He knew exactly what to do, pointed out what was wrong with previous cuts, and had the confidence and skills to really give me a fantastic cut.  He didn't need a lot of direction from me, and wasn't timid about getting in there, and explaining to me what he had in mind while cutting.Mike is an easy-going guy, his shop is clean and comfortable, easy to find and convenient to park.  If you want the best haircut you'll ever have without the unnecessary frills of a typical LA salon, Mike is your guy!  Can't recommend him enough!"
8/15/14,0.206832955,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"In the haircutting profession, there are people who cut hair, and there are people who craft it. Mike is without a doubt the latter.Mike has been around barbering all his life, and it shows. If you walk in with no idea what you want your hair to ""look"" like when you're done, Mike will figure it out. The moment you sit down, he's looking at your hair, asking you relevant questions, and very clearly getting his own visual as to what the end product should be. If you do have an idea what you want it to look like, he's just as adept. Mike knows hair, and he appreciates the value of his craft.Barbering is a profession of trust. You don't go back to a barber you don't trust with your hair, and you won't recommend that barber, either. Note the reviews as of August 15, 2014 - there is not a single one below 5 stars, because Mike is truly a 5-star barber.If he rented a chair at a high-end male grooming establishment, Mike could easily charge double for his work, if not more. Instead, he operates out of a converted closet in the back of a salon, which he has made his own with a quirky automotive/motorcycle theme. Instead of blow drying the cuttings off you at the end of your cut, he uses an air compressor (substantially more effective, IMO), which is sort of hilarious.He's also full of hair styling advice - he's not afraid to get you outside of your comfort zone and give you options and tips.I have absolute trust in Mike as a barber, and I think that's the highest praise you can give someone in this profession."
2/23/17,0.274129336,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My hair is a pain in the ass to cut.  It's thick as hell, grows in different direction, has cowlicks, etc.  Since moving to LA, I had seen a bunch of barbers, none of whom had really made me look good.  Mike came highly recommended, so I went to check him out.  When I sat down, he had very uncomplimentary things to say about the previous barbers' work - and he was right.  He assured me that he would make me look acceptable, but that if I wanted to get to good or even great I'd have to keep coming back.  Mike's standards are obviously higher than my own very high ones because he made me look very good that first time.  After that, it's only gotten better and better.  Mike is very good at cutting my hair.  He's a character for sure and his facilities are out of the ordinary (in a good way, I think), but his barbering skills are totally top notch.  Go have him cut your hair - and keep going back."
6/4/14,0.239705882,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"What I appreciated most about Mike wasn't his friendly attitude, or his really neat setup in the back of the barber shop (both were great btw), it was the way that he immediately sized up my hair and thought about how to realize a great haircut. If you dig a bit, you will find out he's been cutting hair for over 25 years, and that experience shows. I am not good at explaining exactly how I like my hair, but with Mike it was a breeze. He actually suggested the haircut I wanted without me having to even ask. You can tell that he has a commitment to giving you a great haircut, not just because he wants you to come back as a customer, but because he genuinely takes pride in his work. I will be back for sure."
6/16/15,0.151833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike has been cutting my hair for over a year, and he's phenomenal. Takes his time, walks you through what he's doing, and very consistent (and high!) quality. He's a super nice guy, too. Sadly I'm moving across the country and away from my favorite barber, but will definitely drop by for a cut whenever I'm in town. Highly recommended."
4/18/15,0.168143939,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Got my hair cut for the first time with Mike and am very pleased with his work. My girlfriend keeps talking about how good it is!  He really took the time to figure out how to make my (tricky) hair look good and explained what he was seeing and thinking about. He was also super apologetic about running a few minutes late because the people before me were late to their appointment.  Do the guy a favor and call for an appointment and arrive on time!!  This is a one man operation and if one person is very late it screws up the whole day.
9/12/15,0.323333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is an absolute master at cutting hair.  My hair is very difficult to cut and he makes it look easy every time.  He'll take about 5-10 minutes at the beginning of the cut to study my hair and come up with a plan to create a perfect cut that looks awesome and lasts a long time.  On top of everything, Mike is one hell of a nice guy.  Give Mike a try if you want an affordable 5 star cut and a great barber shop experience."
9/24/13,0.496428571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been going to Mike for years and he always treats me great.  The best haircuts I've ever had.  Cut's usually take an hour and way below what he's worth.  Mike cares about doing a great job and not as much about making money.  Try him once and I'm sure you'll agree.Thanks Mike!
10/7/13,0.258636364,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike has been cutting my hair for the last two years, and has to be the best barber in town.  I love his new private space in the back of berkley barbers where you can relax and watch football while Mike gives you an awesome haircut.  Unbelievable haircuts at a great price.  I'll never go to another barber."
1/24/15,0.189393939,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,What a great haircut. Mike really took the time and effort to craft my new look. He went the extra mile all the way. Definitely going back.
9/28/13,0.245443182,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is the consumate professional. I moved to Santa Monica several years ago, and tried several barbers before I came across Mike. I finally found someone who takes great pride in his work and in delivering a high quality customer experience. If you are looking for a highly skilled Barber, at a great price nonetheless, try him out. Not only does he keep notes on past practices, he is wide open to requests and suggestions. Be sure to go to the back of the shop to find his work station. His was very excited to get a separate work space when he recently moved to this new location. He did a nice job of setting up a unique spot for himself, all while continuing to give great cuts."
10/6/13,0.630208333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike has cut my hair for many years. Best cut it town.  Scissor cut and knows exactly how I like it.Flawless every time.  Try him once and you'll always Come back!Thanks for Caring Mike!!  Your are a rarity in the world today.

5/6/16,0.005,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike was great! You can tell he is into his hair cuts and takes pride in his work. By him cutting your hair in front of the mirror you are seeing exactly what he is doing and what might have gone wrong with other barbers.

5/2/15,0.480555556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best haircut I ever got in my life. Mike is extremely cool and his shop is awesome. I hear he is a genius with a straight razor and I will definitely be going in for a shave soon. I feel lucky that I found this guy.

A big one for me is searching out a decent barber. Just as I feel fortunate to have landed, finally, in Santa Monica, I am also fortunate to have run across Mike at Service Station Barbers for my first West Side haircut. Mike is a Journeyman barber. I am not overselling or being dramatic in calling him an artist with his scissors. My first haircut by Mike was probably the best I've ever had, and I've had some great barbers. And his pricing is totally reasonable. As is my preference this is a barber shop, old school, as is Mike. Highly recommended."

6/14/14,0.272159091,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I made an appointment with Mike after reading his positive reviews on Yelp. He gave me a fantastic haircut and really took time and care to consider what would work best for me. The shop is really cool and that garage/service station feel. I will definitely be going back to Service Station Barbers for all of my future haircuts.
7/5/14,0.444781145,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is great, awesome location, and the best haircut in SM. Studio DNA gave me a $125 haircut that was no where near as good. Always really clean cut suited to my hair, and he tries to push you toward trying new styles. Way solid barber."
6/13/14,0.39,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've gone to Mike the Barber for the past 2 years. He's the best. He cuts my hair with care and concern. His Service Station theme is a lot of fun. His professional vision is all about creating a great place to get a haircut.
6/8/14,0.225890653,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Hands down, Mike is the best person I've had cut my hair in the last 10 years of me being very picky with my hair stylists. I also landed my highly sought after job after receiving my interview hair-cut from him, which I am convinced that it played a huge role.  He is highly skilled and meticulous every single time and has if you're as picky as I am, Mike will be the only person you will go to after you meet him."
7/13/14,0.38844697,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike is the best barber around. I called him on a Wednesday and asked if he could cut all of the groomsmen for a wedding on the coming Sunday. He made it happen and did an excellent job on every cut. He is very knowledgeable and talks you through the whole process of what he is doing. His shop is amazing with mirrors that allow you to see all the angles at all times. Most barbers keep you in the dark and don't allow you to see anything till the cut is over. Not so with Mike. He is personable and friendly and does great work. I live an hour from his shop and definitely plan on going back.

A top choice...don't go anywhere else!d"

11/14/13,0.254638752,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is like a cat with nine lives! He has been searching for the right shop and has finally created it!  Service Station Barbers is a cool concept.  He has the shop set up like a high-performance garage.  You have to see it!  It is his own place within  Berkeley Barbers.  It is small but he's got it tricked out the way he wants it.But that's not the reason to go to him.  Mike is FLAT OUT...THE BEST BARBER!  He first does a complimentary shampoo and conditioner then takes the time to do a complete, and fantastic scissor cut.  He takes tremendous pride in his work and always nails it.  A comfortable room with TV, music, whatever you want.  BUT WAIT...that's not all.  He also does an old fashioned hot shave on the back of the neck and finishes the session with a neck and shoulder machine massage.  Seriously!  And the whole deal... $20!!  I suggest tipping heavily!  This guy is the real deal.  Yes, he can do the clipper cut or the fade or shave your head but he's really committed to giving you the best haircut possible.  Once you go to him, your search will be OVER!  You will be a devoted follower.  I have followed him through 4 shops and he is at the top of his game.  Good guy, great haircut. A+++++ is right!"

The last couple times I went for a walk-in they were full the rest of the day. I needed a cut before new years so I called this shop and he was still taking cuts.I walked in and it looked like an autoshop, really small but awesome layout. The tools hanging from the ceiling, very clean and organized. Mike was friendly and personal and really knows what hes doing and loves what he does. Theres only one chair in his shop which is a room connected to berkleys barbers. Its personal and he takes his time to make it look nice.Glad I found it cause my hairs looking fresh for the new year and I was his last customer/my last cut of 2013. Great vibes here."

The guy has been cutting hair for a long time and is extremely skilled with all scissor cuts. Also washes your hair for free, which is a good touch."
9/10/13,0.300740741,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike is THE BEST!!!! He gives a great hair cut and the first time I went to him he took down notes. I just call him (@310-866-8571 in case any one needs his #) when I need a haircut and go in. Mike looks at his past notes and gets the job done. Highly recommended.

10/1/13,0.159583333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been following Mike around for a few years. First at Lincoln Barbers then Pico Barbers and now here in his private little spot at Berkeley Barbers. His prices are super reasonable and he absolutely cares about what he does. I've recently moved to the eastside and it's a pain in the ass to get there but I couldn't go anywhere else. The guy is the best.

5/3/15,0.287922078,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,The five star reviews are right on. Mike is the best. I've floated from barber to barber all my life and never been quite satisfied. I have very thick South American hair and no none knew how to handle it quite right with the scissors. He got it right the first time and each cut seems to get better and better. I'll keep coming to Mike as long as he and I are around.
1/4/14,0.5,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike is the man. Give him a call and he'll make sure you don't have to wait. There's nothing like a haircut with samurai shears followed by a car buffer shoulder massage.

12/6/13,0.095454545,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Not only is Mike a meticulous artist but he is also a gentleman. I found him on Yelp a couple months ago and was impressed by his attention to detail. It usually takes working with a barber for months to figure out how I like my fade. He got pretty damn close on the first try then took a pict to attach to my contact info for the next time. As to the gentleman. I am a poor student and Army reservist. I had my monthly commitment the following day and was in desperate need of a clean-up. I went to Mike with my situation and $16. Not only did he not turn me away but he gave me a great cut, and on his birthday no-less. Go see this guy."

Love how he has the TV, and internet, etc. Very mellow atmosphere. Every time I get my hair cut, he has some cool new toy he's added to his shop. A+++ barber!"
11/4/14,0.428205128,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I must admit, my cut is an easy one, a short fade. Though, that being said, Mike put more focus and care into than any before him. While many move quick and get me out of the chair with a simple cut. Mike took the time to make sure it was lined up well, faded well, just perfect. The warm shaving cream shave of the neck area was a wonderful bonus! I will be going back to Mike on the regular. I felt good walking out of there, and that is what I want."
1/9/14,0.262037037,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is simply the best. I've lived on the Westside for 7 years, frequented Tel's Barber Shop for a number of them. Mike takes pretty incredible pride in his work (guy uses Hattori Hanzo shears for god sakes) and even better is a down to earth cool dude to spend some time with while getting a cut. I'm 4 haircuts in and won't go anywhere else. He also works eary and late 7 days a week so as a working professional it dosn't get any better. Definitely look Mike up and you'll thank everyone who gave 5 stars on here later!"
11/3/14,0.28532967,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Very special barber ""station"". I found out about this barber shop while being on vacation in L.A. As I am kind of picky with my haircut I hesitated. But not only is it a very cool, stylish, different and inviting place, Mike also is a very sensitive and calm professional. He helped me out immediately and I had no doubt at all that he knew what he was doing from the beginning. Definitely will I go there again when back in LALA. Very good price level as well. Thanks again and cheers from Germany!"
9/12/13,0.565,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Mike is amazing. Great attention to detail. An artist with hair! Better than all the high end stylist's I used to see.
6/22/14,0.205087719,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I had been unhappy with my previous hair stylist. I found Mike and I'm extremely happy that I did. He takes the time to tell you how he is cutting your hair and why he is doing it. He is a very detail oriented guy and the end result shows. I really appreciate the care and focus he put into my haircut. The fade he gave me was seamless. Easy going guy and very polite guy. The whole vibe of his setup is very cool and unique. He gave me a great and stylish haircut that fit me as an individual. He is the kind of stylist that will tailor a specific haircut/style to your specific needs.  Thank you Mike, I'm a fan."
8/15/14,0.30625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Brilliant haircut by an incredibly nice guy. Mike takes the time to figure out your hair before he starts cutting. He is humble and asks questions to make sure you get the exact haircut you came in for. Great straight razor shave for the neck and he threw in a beard trim as well. Can't beat it at any price, let alone $25."
9/23/13,0.172842057,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is as professional and skilled as a barber can be.  The first time I went to him, he took down notes, took a picture of my cut and stored it all in his phone, so that when I called him, he knew exactly how to cut my hair.  He takes his time and makes sure there are no details missed.  He has created a atmosphere at his new location (with parking in back) which makes things very convenient and relaxing in the hustle and bustle of LA.  I've been going to Mike for about 8 months and will be for as long as I live in LA!"
8/30/13,0.08872549,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is a tremendous barber. He has been cutting my hair (and trimming my beard) for about a year now, and I wouldn't want to go to anyone else. Mike is great with my long hair. Other barbers would make it wildly uneven, or simply cut it short. Mike knows just what to do, and he only charges a few extra dollars for long hair. His shop is comfortable, and he is a really nice guy as well. I also love that you can call him directly at the number above and make an appointment."
10/4/13,0.35172619,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,If you're in need of a solid scissor cut Mike is the best! He really takes pride in delivering a perfect cut every time and take the time to make sure everything come out just right. You can tell Mike has been doing this a long time as his technique and skill are evident in every cut. I get tons of compliments on his cuts and the price is outastanding given the quality of his work.  I'd highly recommend giving him a call 310-866-8571. NOTE: MIKE IS LOCATED IN THE BACK OF THE BUILDING. SOME TIMES OTHER BARBERS ON THE PREMESIS WILL TRY TO TALK YOU INTO USING THEM. INSIST ON SEEING MIKE. HE IS THE BEST.
10/10/13,0.405009921,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mike is the best barber I've ever had, hands down. I have paid twice as much for haircuts that weren't nearly as good as what Mike provides his clients. He really understands hair and is able to cut and style to exactly what you want. 5 STARS!!"
9/21/14,0.375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"The reviews are no joke.  Best haircut I've ever had!  Mike is personable, caring, and a skilled craftsman.  He's an artist.  I've been in the Supercuts loop for sometime and need a change.  This is just what I needed and will DEFINITELY be going back."
5/25/14,0.326607143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"When I got to the place, I was very early for my appointment. Mike told me he'd see me at 4. So I went and killed time and came back at 4. Mike wasn't quite ready for me, so, right off the bat, he was running late. I wasn't in a rush so it didn't really affect me. But, if it wasn't for the AMAZING haircut Mike gave me, taking his time to make sure it was perfect, I would've given this 4 stars. But Mike did an excellent job with my hair, plays great music and is an overall nice guy. I highly recommend all people go and visit him. You won't regret it. I got all sorts of compliments from people about the cut. Thanks Mike!"
6/11/14,0.629333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"There's a reason Mike has exclusively 5 star reviews: He earns them. There's a difference between a generally good barber -- let's call that guy a journeyman -- and someone who does truly excellent work and takes genuine pride in that work. I'd call that guy a craftsman. And to me that's a good description of Mike. He's conscientious. He takes pride in doing very good work. And maybe just as important; he listens and then honestly works to satisfy not just his customer -- but also himself. In a word, he's a five star barber. He's also a gentleman, a guy who makes your time with him pleasant and interesting. Not a bad way to spend 30 minutes or so.  Norm L"

4/6/14,0.375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great work.  Mike squeezed me in on short notice even though you usually need an appointment and gave me my favorite haircut to date.  He does an awesome job and really seems to have an image in mind for his customers and cares how they look.

1/2/14,0.153492063,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"After about a year of trial and error, my search for an old-school barber who is an artisan in love with his craft and at the top of his game (to replace another artisan who finally retired), I can rest. Mike is easily the best barber I've ever had. I'm an actor, fussy about my hair, and tired of trying to explain to clippers-only guys how to give me a short cut that isn't a scalping. Mike is a scissors man and a careful, considerate craftsman who really spends time and effort to satisfy both his client and himself that he's got it right. He's been doing it for decades, in high-end markets, and I found myself trusting him completely within minutes. This, plus the facts that he's a nice guy with a neat private shop set up as a race-car garage, and that he includes a shampoo and a serious after-cut massage in the $25 tab, nails it for me. Tip well! He deserves it."
