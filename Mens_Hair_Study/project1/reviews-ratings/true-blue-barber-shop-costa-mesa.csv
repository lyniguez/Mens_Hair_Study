3/26/18,0.25,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,My barber was booked solid so i gave these guys a shot... Charged me $40 for a beard trim and my neck line up... do yourself a favor check out Hawleywoods they're better and cheaper
2/6/18,0.229166667,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I've been coming here for the past couple of years and it has been a great experience. The vibe and haircuts are great however, this time was different. The haircut took about 45-50 minutes and after each switch of blades or clip size, the barber checked his phone every time. Now I usually don't care because its done once or twice in any barbershop you go to, but he did so frequently and for so long, it was very aggravating and quite disrespectful. I think it also took away from the cut. The taper was not blended correctly and the length was not correct. If one is paying 30$, a great experience is required for the price hike (used to be 25$). Maybe request a different barber for a better experience. (Avoid barber directly overlooking the tv)."
1/26/18,0.47209596,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,5,Awesome people ! I was around the area and i was looking for a barber shop and i found this great little place on yelp. I didn't see you had to make an appointment . One of the barber had an open spot and took me in! The barber was awesome. I love my new hair cut and i like how he took his time in doing it. Great place! I will be going back again!!
6/1/17,0.184376026,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I have gone to this shop maybe a dozen times with no issues but after this last time I won't be going back. I always saw Jeff, and for some reason the fade in the back was way lower than usual on my last visit. So I think no worries it's only been two days (my gf told me about it because I hadn't noticed the back of my head immediately), I'm sure Jeff will fix it because he seemed like a somewhat cool dude and we had built a rapport. So I call and he says that I need to schedule an appointment. So I think that's cool I understand they are a busy shop. So I make an appointment, Jeff fixes it and then I shake his hand and go to leave he tells me that it will be full price..... Uhh bro, let's think about this, how much could my hair have grown in a couple days to warrant paying full price? I tip literally 25% every single cut and you are going to play me like that? Good one.I don't even need to really get into the whole gentrified Newport pseudo-hipster vibes, the cash only vibes (you tax-dodging bruh?), the exclusive-club awkward around newcomers vibes, the ragging on previous customers after they leave vibes, or the overpriced vibes. I just ignored all that noise because at the end of the day I just want my hair cut. I don't care how many Jack Daniel's posters you have, how many beers you offer me while I wait, how well done your tattoos are, how high the sleeves are rolled up on your plaid flannel, or any of that other bs. I just want my hair cut to look good, and own any mistakes you make because like, you know, customer service or something?No worries though because there's like 20 shops in a 5 mile radius so you just gotta move on to the next one lol."
1/11/18,0.15,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Been coming here for like 2 years now. Finch always gives me a solid cut and I am usually in and out within like 30-40 minutes. They only do appointments which means you don't have to wait. They always offer a water when you walk in and the rest of the guys seem pretty cool. Normal dudes giving good haircuts and doesn't have the shitty vibe my last place had.
5/10/17,0.26,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Spacious and comfortable barber shop, good vibe. TVs, magazines, antiques, etc. Took my 7 yr old son, we got haircuts from Doug. $15 for kid cut, $20 for adult. Look forward to coming back."
10/17/17,0.183928571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Third shop I've followed my barber to... somehow every move is conveniently closer to work. Not that the drive matters because Doug's the best barber in town.Of the three shops this one is by far my favorite. Everyone is always friendly and jokes around. It's got cool decor. The music is good and not so loud you can't have a conversation. Sometimes movies are on but they're conscious of what's on/playing when kids are in. There's rarely an empty chair when I walk in... there's also rarely someone waiting... they run a tight ship, make an appointment, and don't be late. Your barber's and every following customer's time is dependent on a little courtesy."
10/20/17,0.3125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"By far the best barbers in the OC. For those with negative posts, don't go back. They have plenty of customers that appreciate a great cut at a great price. Yup they are always busy. Here's a fix make an appointment and before you leave make your next.. Dooh, that's a no brainer.Eli has been my go to for over 15 years."
12/28/16,0.117666667,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"I've been wanting to go here for a while, but they are always booked up. I called and got an appointment and got in, but they had me for a later time. Came back an hour later. I felt comfortable, but kinda an outsider at the same time. It's definitely a high demand club for hipsters. I wanted a shave and some advice on how to shape my beard. After the shave everything seemed fine, but driving home I noticed some areas that should have been shaved. When I got home I spent over an hour redefining. Okay experience, but unfortunately a waste of money and time. You guys can keep your fancy barber shop."

6/3/17,0.0375,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,This place is appointment only. I have been here a couple of time but today was the last time I will set foot in this barbershop. I had an 8:45am appointment and waited 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. Apparently the barber that was supposed to cut my hair didn't show up and they couldn't reach. Of course they didn't mention this until I was walking out the door and to add salt to injury they offered to cut my hair at 1pm. There's a reason why I booked an early appointment and it's not to wait around 4 hours to get a haircut.
3/1/17,0.126041667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Eli has been cutting my hair for more than a decade, started out in a three and a half chair, one sink shop, then to a larger place with his buddy, when the buddy mistreated him he did not get mad, he just opened up a great place of his own. Top notch service. Check him and his guys out. Tell him Tom sent you."
12/10/17,0.441666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This place is awesome! Dane cut my 17 year old son's hair just like the photo he brought in. My son loves hanging with the guys AND he looks great! Thanks Dane and True Blue!!!!
1/25/17,0.20625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Second time here and it was worth it. I dont get my hair cut very often, but when I do, I don't like it to look like a fresh hair cut. You know what I mean? Whether you cut 1/2 inch or 2 inches, I like it look like I always had it that way, so no one even notices. Doug understood this perfectly. He even asked extra questions to make sure he knew exactly what I wanted. He set me up good and trimmed the top about 1/2"" cut the back, sides about 1"" and cleaned up my neck and beard. He also left it a little rugged around the ears and I could barely tell I even had it cut. Just how I like it.  I'll definitely be back."
7/20/17,1,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"The best place to get a haircut in the south orange county area, Finch is my Go to barber now! 30 bucks with a tip... trust me... for the quality of the cut, you cannot beat that price anywhere"
3/8/17,-0.116666667,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,Good haircuts. Bad customer service. If your late they will refuse you service by calling people you have recommended to the shop and tell them to tell YOU not to come back or they will 86 ALL of you. Piss poor service from a cash only shop.
11/1/16,0.245128205,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is perfect.  Cash only, know that up front.Priced extremely well for the level of service.  The way it should be.Quality is excellent, Finch is my guy now, second time there and no difference in attention.Make an appt, if you walk-in I expect you'd wait a bit as they are busy.Facility is classic, mix of low and high brow in one though leaning more on the high side.People coming out of there all look on point.Got familiar with them through a photo project I had to do there for my company, 5.11.  Here's the story and photos: spark.adobe.com/page/wRW…I don't see myself going anywhere else as long as I'm local to this area."
5/8/17,0.12756734,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,Got a haircut like 3 months back. I had an 8am booking and knew I would be 6 minutes late so I called with 5 minutes notice Bc I live down the street. He still took me in and did a phenomenal job. Small talk is always there but I'm just a guy that likes to sit and kind of sleep while the barber does his magic. I'm not too picky of the cut yet I would go back to him. Totally forgot his name Bc I'm just now writing a review from awhile ago. I'll be going back this week though :)
12/28/16,0.196944444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Spectacular service.  Skilled barbers.  This is a very professional place.  You make an appointment then you will just come in and get your haircut.  Chill vibe here, they cut your hair and have a huge TV in the center of the room that everyone can watch.  No obnoxious banter between staff.  No one pushing their hair products sale.  Professional barbers that get the job done.  Been cut up by Dane, Finch, Doug.   All guys are skilled and can do what you need.  Simple fades, scissor taper... whatever you ask for.  Tips:-Make an appointment (I called in the same day and got in, lucky though)-No broke kids, $25 (minus tip) get you a haircut -Cash only"

Felt like a new man after leaving. Thanks Shea, I will definitely be back when I'm due for my next cut. Absolutely make an appointment about 4-5 days before you want to be cut. Nice old school barber feel to this place. Cheers."

Barbers won't talk your ear off.  I've had some great cuts from Jeff.  Be clear about what you want and he can make it happen.  Also, this place is busy, so call ahead and make an appointment. They rarely have space in the schedule for walk-ins."

5/4/15,0.151903409,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is clean, manly, and awesome. Jeff cut my hair and did an awesome job. He was even really cool about the fact that I didn't know this was a cash-only facility and let me leave for a few minutes to go to the ATM next door and didn't give me a hard time about it. These guys are great to be around and I really enjoyed my experience. I've only been here twice and cannot continue going because I live out of state, but I would go here every month if I could! For people who have negative experiences or are on the fence about this place, let me make it simple...If you expect a fanfare, roses at your feet, and a big cheesy grin when you walk in the door... This place is not for you.If you are a scrawny high schooler trying to be a hipster... This place is not for you.If you cannot handle watching an R-rated, potentially gory movie on an 80 inch flatscreen... This place is not for you.If you cannot walk in and be told you need an appointment without running off like a yellowbelly...This place is not for you.Do you know which place is for you? Supercuts. Supercuts is for you....However, if you are manly BAMF with cash in your pocket... THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU!"

I wanted to try and new style than what I have been going with. Walked in to a warm greeting and sat down quickly with Eli, we discussed on how to make my new style look and he killed it! I love the old school barber shop vibe. This place I will definitely be coming back to. Thank you Guys!"
1/2/15,0.091837522,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I get that this is a place to get a rockabilly haircut from rockabilly hipsters who are good at their jobs. It's kind of like a salon for vain pretentious men who may think that going to a ""old school"" barber and drinking a beer might be mistaken for personality.I myself am a man who usually keeps his whole head at a No.1 so 99.9% of the time if I simply walk in it's no problem. So that's exactly what I did. When I walked in I was made to feel like I pissed on everybody's sunshine. I sat down in the chairs backed against the wall to a collective look of WTF are you doing here?The first person who acknowledged me asked if I was an appointment that he was expecting. I told him I was a walk in, and he proceeds to tell me that they work by appointment only and the next spot was Wednesday. This was on a Friday. So I chose my last option which was to walk out with my tail between my legs and douche chills running up my spine. It was the right choice for me. I am a balding man who's hair requires very little upkeep. I don't need a IPA with my haircut I just wanted to clean up a bit, well I guess this place is too cool for me.Fuck it there's always supercuts."

And the quality beats anything else around."
3/13/14,0.34375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Finch is a great barber here, well they all are but Finch cuts my hair on the regular.  He spends his time making sure you get a great cut.  Never a complaint here.  It is possible to sit through a movie like Urban Cowboy and still have an enjoyable experience here.   Word of advise, make an appointment."
10/25/15,0.115151515,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I relocated to Costa Mesa around 2 years ago.  I tried a few places in the area and nothing had really warranted my loyalty.  Cut to... a late evening haircut at a local salon ""school"".  After having the worst haircut of my life and feeling violated by a lady who had no clue what she was doing, I stumbled upon True Blue via Yelp.  Yes, I was a late night walk in.  Whether it was my f*&cked hair or sheer pity, Finch agreed to do the clean up.  Left the shop that night with my dignity in tact and the sense that I found my new spot.  Since my first visit...I've never had an issue, always a good time and Finch is consistent and a great guy. I've since relocated across the country but still fly back every month to True Blue...cheers"
2/14/15,0.219173882,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"True Blue is a great shop. I went into my second appointment with Shae (after a perfect first cut by him) to try a new style. I usually go with a basic pompadour but I wanted to try an undercut. The issue was that my hair was really curly because I hadn't blow dried it so I didn't give him an easy job. He gave me the cut and it looked odd because of how curly my hair was so I walked out unsure. When I got back I showered up and then blow dried and styled, and it was perfect. The lengths were all right and it blended right where I asked and hung over right where I asked as well. This dude worked with nothing and pulled off another great cut. I'm definitely going to Shae for every possible future haircut. Thanks guys!"

First off, I've been to a lot of places looking for a good cut. This place is awesome and super reasonably priced for what you get. I heard about it through some guys at work that go here. I used their rec and set an appt with Jeff. He is killer and and cuts a damn good fade and part.I got my brother going her too, using Finch. Best cut he's ever gotten also.The entire establishment is top notch."

I walk in and was taken back by the atmosphere of a REAL barbershop. I have been to many mens salons to get my hair cut but never a true barbershop. I sat down with Shae, went over what I was looking for and he went to work-not to mention my hair is a bit difficult to cut. I was impressed with the precission he took to really get the look I was going for. He did a great job and the place is reasonably priced. If you are looking for a great barbershop, look no further!"

1/22/14,0.048026562,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I came into True Blue for a shave and a haircut. I've been wet shaving for over a year now, and was thrilled to find a barber shop that offered straight razor shaves. The prep for the shave was top notch - but the shave itself was another story. I've never had such awful razor burn in my whole life, with a matching assortment of nicks and weepers just to round the experience out. After the shave was done my face felt and looked like a red hot mess. I alerted the barber to this, expressed my dissatisfaction, and was told there was nothing he could do about it. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this establishment. I really liked the atmosphere, and the barbers here all had a great barber shop personality. The hair cut was solid, but the straight razor shave (which is actually a shavette using Feather blades) just mauled my face. Come here for a haircut only and your gold. Add a shave and you're in for a world of hurt.Response to owner:I understand that your business has been offering hot lather shaves for a while, but Shay's technique suggests he's very new to straight razor shaving. There's nothing wrong with a lack of experience, but his technique translated into a truly awful shave that cost me $25! Also, I did come in with 2 days of growth, and as for the DE blades I use at home, they're Feathers! So again, this translated down to one thing - technique. I would hope as a business owner that you would stop attempting to deflect blame towards your (ex) customer, and instead work with Shay to improve his technique. He really is a nice guy. He just needs some help."

My cousin recommended me to Eli and True Blue and I can't say enough good things about them.Eli is such a professional and really goes the extra mile with his clients, something I haven't experienced before at a barber shop. He's very precise with his haircuts using a straight razor on the sides and back of the neck and even adds in a hot towel and neck massage at the end to really top things off. Once you enter you are offered water or beer and it is a really relaxing environment with something funny or sports related on the TV. Tip these guys well, they deserve it and they only work off appointments and do not take walk-ins so do make sure to call ahead and bring cash."
3/13/14,0.240129124,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"So I have been going to the same supercuts for about a year and I have this lady who usually does my hair. I really wanted to change things up and decided to grow out my hair and try an ACTUAL barber shop. I went ahead and yelped places and found that this place was close to where I live and had a ton of good reviews so naturally I said why not. I called them up, made an appointment and headed on over. One thing you have to take into consideration is that you need to call before hand before going in. They guys are super chill and can set up a time pretty quickly. When you pull up to it you might be thrown off because it is in a mini business plaza and the shop is labeled BARBER but it is definitely a great place once you walk in. There are 4 comfortable leather chairs, a big screen TV, and you're offered a drink before you sit down....i felt like a mad men character.One thing I'm not super great at is describing a hairstyle to a barber. Usually I say one thing and end up with something completely different. Brandon is such a pro. I gave him small pointers and he got what i wanted and he got it right away. I really liked how the main focus here is to make sure that the customer feels relaxed. I got a haircut, got my hair treated with different products that I feel added shine and volume, i got my neck hair taken care of with a straight razor and some awesome moisturizer, I even got a mini neck message with this machine thing...These guys are really good. best barber experience ever."

I searched around online and found a lot of great recommendations for this place, they did not disappoint. Very laid back atmosphere and professional. A much appreciated and needed flashback to the ""manly"" barbershops of days gone by.  The service and cut is unsurpassed. I haven't had my hair short in a very long time and Shea gave me the perfect cut! Great attention to detail and a cool dude. I booked my next appointment before I left. If you are looking for a great cut in a great place for a great price, you can do no better!"
7/2/16,-0.089166667,Negative,1,3.0 star rating,3,The haircuts are decent and it is not too difficult to get an appointment. The barbers themselves are a bit clicky and not open to conversation with their customers other than the initial staredown and question when you first walk in the door.

I've been coming to Eli for about 9 years now and I do not need to ever tell him how to cut my hair. He already knows. Very professional and no nonsense atmosphere.  Everyone there is very inviting and strives to do the best damn cut possible. Nice open floor and great viewings on the TV. Over all, great place for a guy to come and relax for an hour getting a new cut or a hot towel shave. Do yourself a favor and come here. Sure shops are popping up all over the place, but only the true quality barbers will outshine. This place is one of them. You will not be disappointed!!!"

5/22/16,0.171658897,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been bouncing around from barbershop to barbershop in orange county for the past year and a half, and I have not claimed myself loyal to any establishment until now. Because I live in the fountain valley/westminster area, I tend to find myself going to walk in barbershops such as kenny's or fade it, where you have to wait 3 hours just to get a haircut. Usually there is only one or two good barbers working at a time and the others are extremely inconsistent. Sure the cut is Cheap (not really though if you, get your beard trimmed as well), but those barbers are like a game of roullette. Finally, after doing some serious digging on yelp, I came across true blue and was scheduled with Finch. Finch is an awesome guy and has done an amazing job on my beard and my hair for the past couple of months. He takes his time, really tries to figure out exactly how you want your cut done, and  communicates with you through the whole process. After the cut, i got a hot shave to line everything up perfectly, and a complimentary neck massage. They offer their customers complimentary beer and water and they always have something interesting playing on their big tv. Also there is no wait because true blue is mostly an appointment only barbershop. The only issue is if you need to get a haircut last minute as in my situation. When i tried to make an appointment on tuesday for upcoming friday, Finch was unavailable. Because I was truely desperate for a cut I asked to be set up with another barber. I Had an appointment with shae, and he as well did an amazing job with my hair, which shows there is great consistency among the barbers throughout the shop. Highly recommend this spot to everyone!"

If you're okay with a shitty haircut, go to super cuts but you want something clean and professionally done go to true blue."

I hadn't been in a few months while I was looking for a new barber. Finch hooked it up this time, and I'm very impressed. He asked how I wanted it and got to work. I haven't had a cut look or feel this good since my last barber in Alhambra. I also have the kind of hair that poofs out if it's not kept long enough (unless it's buzzed), and he knew the exact length to tame it. He also cleaned up my cut with a straight razor shave!The place is clean and not at all intimidating. The barbers were hilarious with the banter between each other. Come here if you want real barbers with a cut that you're happy with. $25 per cut, complimentary drink, and a great atmosphere. Don't forget to tip!  I don't usually make the next appointment right after a cut, but I was so satisfied, I did."

Maybe I am crazy but anumber one on the side fade shouldn't be...............25$ really, I get my hair cut, same quality and the beer for 11$ in Brea. I won't be coming back unless the prices come down."

I don't feel out of place like some other places I've gone to, to get a haircut as good as I get here. 25 bucks for a meticulous cut and razor trim around the edges."

Great layout in the shop, great music as well as a big screen TV that normally has a game on. If you're looking for a truely professional haircut True Blue is the place to go.Keep up the good work guys."
3/2/13,0.321428571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Clean, classy, refreshing.  The cuts are awesome and they pay attention to detail. This isn't one of those places you walk in and walk out. They take the time to make sure it's nice and tidy.The guys here are super cool and personable. I've been getting my hair cut by one of the guys here for almost two years now. They know their customers like a true barber should. The shop has a genuine old school feel complete with a vinyl record player. Too legit. I think the only thing that's missing are powder soap dispensers in the bathroom. If you are a guy I don't understand how you could go anywhere else."

I had an idea of what I wanted and Finch pretty much filled in the gaps and gave me exactly what I wanted! And everyone is super friendly as well. They take the time to give you what you want that you almost feel bummed that the experience is over. These guys gained a new customer, and anyone looking would do themselves a service by paying these guys a visit!"

12/16/15,0.4125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I had heard great things and was dissatisfied with my usual hair dresser so I made an appointment. I walked in and they immediately offered me a drink which set the tone as a friendly barber shop vibe and told me my barber would be Finch. All the guys looked like they were doing great cuts so I was happy to get whomever. I brought a picture of a cut I liked and Finch immediately said ""you want something like an undercut"" which showed he was very knowledgeable with current men's fashion cuts. I got to watch a movie as he cut my hair and when the chair was turned around for me to see the result I was very pleased. He finished by cleaning up the edges with a warm lather and straight shave around the neck and edges (which was why I wanted to switch to a men's barber). He then topped it all off with a brief neck massage with a neck massager. Over all I was very impressed with the atmosphere and barbers themselves. I will be back again for my monthly cuts."

From sitting on a skateboard, to the cowboy movie playin on the screen - he was in heaven. This is a man's place but everyone was super accommodating to us and Shea did a great job with the haircut. Skip the corny kids haircut spot and get your little guy a real hairstyle here."

I had an appointment with Finch this morning and true to the other reviews, Finch first listened to what I wanted, took his time and gave me the BEST haircut I've had period! If you need a great haircut in a real barber shop (not some pretend wannabe establishment) this is the place to go. Incredible value!"
5/27/14,0.289166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Went there for the first time today. Really friendly and nice barber shop. Have a beer or water while waiting or on the chair. I got a hair cut from Jeff. Cool guy. I can highly recommend him. I will definitely go there again.

Like other guys have said, there's a chill, professional atmosphere and the goal seems to be to give the best cut possible in a clean, cool and relaxed shop. Shea gave me a great cut and I'll be back for sure. I might prefer music over the TV, but that's just me. Great barber shop."

3/6/13,0.215151515,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have been getting my hair cut by Eli Justice for years. Finally he has broken away from the drama of his previous employer. Same quality hair cut / shave. Brought some great talent over with him as well in Brandon and Jeff. A group of stand up guys who just want to cut hair. Does not get much better than this in terms of traditional barbershops. Great customer service which had been very lacking in previous shops. Great establishment with no attitudes. Congratulations gentlemen on a well thought out and executed shop.

2/27/13,0.195725108,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"First visit at True Blue and I'm definitely coming back. Some of the Hawleywoods guys broke off and started their own shop. Good move.  All are incredibly talented.  Jeff cut my hair while the other barbers were watching and quoting every single one-liner in ""The Big Lebowski""...classic!  When done, I had a perfect cut, exactly what I asked for.  Jeff has given me everything from a sick flat top to a ""mad men""-esque cut; he can do it all.  As for the shop, it's got a clean, aquatic theme, while still maintaining a barbershop feel.  To top it off they're complimentary ""true blue"" comb is rad.  Well done men."
4/2/15,0.114583333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I use Jeff and Finch because I can't commit to an appointment too far in advance. Usually one of them is open when I need to get in, so it works! The fact I have two guys that I can trust with my difficult hair is amazing. Always a great cut and a classic vibe. Give the boys a visit and they'll have you coming back for life."
5/21/13,0.1875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"AWESOME!Even though I'm sure he could have given me a satisfactory haircut in seconds, Finch cut my hair as if he were an artist carefully creating a masterpiece. The extra lengths that he went to made me think that he was doing something extra that I was going to pay for in the end. To my pleasant surprise, Finch actually charged me less than what I expected, stating that it was an easy cut. This is the first time that I ever ""enjoyed"" getting a haircut.Oh yeah, he did a killer job as well. Thanks Finch."

They are phenomenal with a straight razor and your hair is perfect when you leave. The environment is chill and laid back, kinda hard to find but that's kind of the beauty of the place. Hands down the best shop in Costa Mesa."

12/10/13,0.15,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,I'm surprised nobody mentioned Finch. He did a long hair cut on me and really took his time. I was a bit skeptical at first since since no one in there had long hair but I was really pleased with the end results. These guys take pride in their work and do a very good job! Definitely will be coming back. Thanks again Finch.

2/1/14,0.262044818,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is awesome. Shay cut my hair. I went in for my second cut after letting it grow out for two months since my first visit. I told him to make me look fly. The next day a girl who'd spurned me a few months previous saw me on my bike heading to a friends house and texted me to see what I was doing that night. I thought the haircut was pretty good but that right there proves it; you can't argue with results. Also, he used the razor to clean up my hairline making me look super fresh without any nicks or razor burn. Beer in the fridge, good music, funny barbers, and a sick haircut. I'll cry if this place ever goes out of business."
