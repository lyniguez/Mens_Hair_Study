First and foremost, this lounge has a very chill, clean, and an easy going atmosphere. All the barbers are friendly and would seem like they go out of their way for their clients!I've switched over to Nate a year ago and I haven't been disappointed. Being new to the city and the horror of trying to find a barber on short notice, Nate has lived up to the expectations. He's somehow remembered how I always want my cut since day 1 and the consistency has been A1. He's easy to get along with and I would definitely recommend him to anyone!"

I've gone thru a couple of barbers and stayed with Victoria because I'm very particular about my hair cuts and she never forgets the little details that I'm picky about! This shop is brand new so everything is real nice and clean. They even have a fridge with waters and stuff which they tell you to help yourself to. I have a habit of showing up a little earlier than my appointment but she's always willing to take me. Lol  the owner Mike is also hella cool! But anyways, they take walk-ins. U won't be disappointed with either one of them! Thanks Victoria for always keeping me fresh!! :-)"

I saw the shop was new and he's open six days a week-- important for scheduling. Messaged Mike through yelp and he responded within a couple minutes with possible times for a cut. Got there, place was super clean and well lit with parking right in front.He had a couple questions on style but I gave him what instructions I could and he did his thing. Great instincts and communication in terms of what I needed.  My cut was a perfect balance between style and office-professional for my life. Takes credit card. Highly recommended. Great haircut and experience all around!"
3/29/2018,0.13769230769230767,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,"Nate has been my barber since way back in high school, even before getting licensed and working at a few other high-end shops. Throughout the years, his talent and skill never cease to amaze me. Cleanest tapers and fades, sharp ass line ups, and all too even cuts up top when I need them.See I'm the type of guy to switch it up a lot. Sometimes I go for the slick-back look, or maybe an 8 up top with a taper on the sides, or my favorite high-top/low fade. No matter the style, Nate hits the nail on the head with each cut making me look literally 10x better and cleaner. Very professional and passionate about what he does. You will definitely NOT regret getting cut up by Nate. Hit his personal line @(650)240-6618."

For its proximity to me, its price, and quality - Supreme Clientele cannot be beat. I had the pleasure of having Victoria cut my hair. It must've been fate, as I soon discovered she used to work at a store I currently work at.... what a small world! Victoria and the owner, Mike, were both there and very polite. Victoria was very down-to-earth and made sure I received the exact haircut I wanted. Right off the Colma BART station, this place is definitely very accessible and its surrounding environment gave it a friendly neighborhood feel. I WILL BE BACK!!!"

Came to this joint when it was somewhat new and was blown away with the level of care and precision they take to give you the perfect cut. My barber was Victoria and she was great! She made sure I knew what I wanted, spoke to me along the way and gave updates and was very easy to talk to. I'd highly recommend asking for her!"

I called in to see if there were any vacant appointment spots that day and Mike told me to come in within the next hour and a half.

Mike can do some of the cleanest fades and cleans you up really well! I will definitely be coming back here because this guy really knows how to treat his customers well!5/5 for the amazing haircut!6/5 for awesome customer service!

Not knowing specifically what I want, I was amazed by Mike's marvelous instinct as a perfectionist barber and performed a beautiful fade hairstyle on me. It has made me so confident about myself like never before. The price was pretty fair and the environment was clean and equipped with AC. Definitely a solid five-star recommendation. Make an appointment and try it yourself! Mike真的是一位十分用心，追求完美的理髮師，設計的髮型也是無可挑剔，而且為人幽默風趣，熱情友好。強烈推薦！"

Haven't really settled with one due to my inconsistent nature of styling my hair and what cut I like. In short, I've never been 'wowed' when my cut is finished. Not the barber's fault. My expectations on what I want for a cut just doesn't mesh well when it's all finished.Today was a bit different. Came in for my appointment, waited a bit in their waiting area, and in no time, I was up. I knew what I wanted and Mike went to work. We chatted a bit and I want to say he's probably one of the more friendliest barbers I've met. I'm big on customer service and from my first time here, he gets a thumbs up from me.I wanted a bald fade pompadour hard part. It's exactly how I wanted it. He had that confidence while I was seated there and it showed in his work.Mike, you're great bro!I may have finally settled."

He knows, Black hair styles, Latino, and Asian.He keeps to his appointment schedule, and is flexible with changes with advanced notice. Cash only, and short hours on Monday.He deserves and earns your business. You deserve his attention to detail, and professional service. I already brought a friend who was more than satisfied with the results. Ill be back!"

Moved from NYC about a year ago and it was tough to find a good barber out here so I pretty much go wherever he goes. Nate hooks you up, hit him up for a clean fade. The new shop is nice and clean too and got the old school hip hop to keep the atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!"

He even gel his hair, my son was very pleased with Mike. Our regular barber guy couldn't accommodate our schedule so that's how we found Mike on yelp.  It's a a little further distance for us since we are coming from the mid peninsula but we will most likely come back to Mike again for another cut in a few weeks.  Thanks Mike for the great clean cut!"

I didn't make an appointment, and only waited 15min before I was seated in a chair and started getting my cut. Walked away with a clean cut that Mike made sure I was completely happy with. You absolutely can't go wrong here, Im definitely coming back soon for my next cut."

The windows around the front of the shop allow natural light to come into the shop accentuating the features of what a modern barbershop should look like. The barbers are masters of their craft and very down to earth. Coming from San Francisco, the spot is very accessible via Bart as well as other means of public transportation."

Got cut by Victoria and owner Mike. Barber shop is still kind of new and everything seems like its in good shape. Staff is friendly and easily sparked a convo for it being my first time. I would definitely recommend them to a friend!!

Other places I've been to are either unkept or full of grown men talking smack all day but this place strikes me as professional seeing as my lil one has to listen to these people while he waits.

Although it seems fairly new, it looked nice so I thought I'd give it a try. I took my 8 year old son today for a back to school haircut and Mike did a great job! We didn't have to wait long but I figure soon enough the place will start filling up as more people hear about it. Overall great service, friendly and very clean shop!"
