2/22/18,0.15771645,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Looking for a barber that you can trust with your hair is a daunting task especially if you are new to the area.  I tried numerous barbers my first 5 years living in LA and I was never really content with the finished product. Fortunately, I met Tony 3 years ago and refuse to see anyone else. Tony knows how to cut and do tight fades while also making recommendations based on your head shape and hair (I have Asian people hair).  I walk out feeling confident and comfortable with my hair, kind of a like a brand new man!    The Venice location is convenient because they have parking in the back and the people greet you with water or other beverages when you first walk in.  I trust Tony with my hair and also the stories we share!"
1/4/18,0.19469697,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been exclusively trusting my hair to Tony for years now. He consistently delivers elevated stylish haircuts that help keep me at the top of my game! I am so particular with my hair. That being said, I cannot give a higher recommendation. The equal expertise with a buzzer and scissor is a rarity. That balance is evident in every cut I receive. I'm frequently asked where I get my haircut. From Echo Park to Venice there is no one better! The shop is always stocked with must have grooming products too. Judah and Angel have occasionally cut me and are also experts of their trade."

Can't ask for more than that Showed up on time for my appointment and took a seat because my barber was still cutting another guy's hair. 45 minutes later I was still waiting and no one bothered to say anything, like maybe a ""hey man, sorry we're running behind but he should be ready for you around ___"" or ""Hey this barber is busy, do you want to try someone else?"" which would have helped since a walk-in that showed up after me got a chair five minutes later. Walked out without getting a cut. Pretty frustrating waste of my Friday free time."
3/7/18,0.368055556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Finally found a barber shop that I can trust to always leave with a good cut. It is hard to find a good barber and they all seem good here. Plus free beer.

I've been meaning to write a review since our first visit - my boyfriend has thick hair that grows LIKE CRAZY. I wanted to find a barber shop that not only got the job done, but was aesthetically more his speed/style. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised!! I've accompanied him a few times and it's hit the mark every single time. We met and have worked with Judah, who has been absolutely amazing every visit, and then we met the new addition to the team, Kelly, for yesterday's appointment. This group is attentive, really listens to us and what we're looking for, and above all else, EXTREMELY kind and friendly! Kelly worked her magic yesterday (we were looking for an even shorter cut than usual because of the unbearable heat) and he was thrilled with the results!Please, if you're considering this place, hesitate no further. It's such a special experience. Luckily we won't have to wait very long to go back!!"

I've been to lots of barber shops and most of them are no where near as clean as this one. The tall dude at the front desk was super friendly and welcoming the second I walked in. My barber Judah faded me up nice and clean and he was super quick as well. In my opinion, going to a barber shop should be a fun, chill experience and I got that and more at Manly & Sons. I would for sure recommend this barber shop to anyone in Venice. And as a fan of Christmas, I was stoked to see the decor and Christmas music playing as well. If you need a new barber, I highly recommend Judah Leary he's a boss"

11/30/17,0.335635769,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"So as I adopted a shorter cut, I was looking for a place to call home. Manly & Sons had just opened up, but I thought I would shop some of the other local barbershops. All in all, Manly ended up being the hands-down winner.Why? The people are great. The environment is great. I sit down and have a beer with my cut. Where in the world do you get that kind of experience?But most of all, the cut is spot on. After I went to this one the girlfriend told me, ""Yes, this place from now on."" I go to Frankie. But don't go to Frankie. Because as much as I love supporting great people that do amazing work, I really don't want to have to fight to get my spot in his chair. He's a Thursday / Friday guy but I think he recently added a new day. Bottom line is if you're looking for a laid back place to get a great cut and feel like a proper man, this is it."
12/12/17,-0.241666667,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Worst haircut I've ever had. Asked for a bald faded pompadour. Because of how long my hair is on the top (about 7-8 inches) the lack of  symmetry is so obvious. When I tie my hair up in a bun it's even worse. It looks like a blind man with epilepsy cut my hair. If you don't have a eye for accuracy and balance, get out of this industry. I've been wearing beanies for weeks after this cut."
12/21/17,0.15,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I am very picky and difficult to please when it comes to my hair and reluctantly tried these guys after all the hype I heard and read, but surprisingly, they were VERY GOOD! Hard to find someone who will cut your hair the way you like too but these guys are very versatile, friendly, and talented!I didn't think there were would be much difference between your typical barbershop and the latest gentlemen's barbershop experience where they even give you beer and a shot of whiskey (H0LY COW! lol), but there is a HUGE difference anyway, and if style is what you're going for then these cool, young, hipster types will show you what's in and what's not, compared to Grandpa Joe who smells like stale cigars.AnyHOO....it's totally worth it and Tony Pin (out of Venice but I'm pretty sure he works in Echo Park too) will be cutting my dew from now on. I just have to cut back on a few espressos to break even and I'll be all set. WARNING: It might ruin your generic barbershop experience forever!"
10/2/17,0.63125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best shop in Venice! This shopIs the most beautiful shop out of all 3 locations. The staff is friendly and professional. You can feel 100 percent confident that you will walk out looking better then you arrived. They are amazing at what they do. All the men in my family go to manly and sons! Great atmosphere, good energy, good cuts, and great people."
10/17/17,0.172873577,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Found this spot on Yelp and took a chance coming in as a walk-in.  It's always kind of nerve wracking when you get a new stylist, and I was assigned Kelly.  I couldn't have been luckier! Being an asian guy, it's tough to find someone who can work with my straight and challenging type of hair. However, I could tell right away she's had experience working with asian hair, and she's obsessive about symmetry and lines as I am.  I've only been twice, both of which cuts i've been super happy with, but I'm committed from here on out. The place isn't very big, space for i believe 4 or 5 max, but the decor and vibe is laid back and inviting. Parking can be a bit of a challenge, so just take that into account and show up 10-15 minutes early. I used to drive 45 minutes to my previous barber, but now super grateful I've found a better one just down the street."
2/17/18,0.296919192,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place really thought of adding exceptional hospitality to their offering.  High quality, haircuts, service, and comfort.  This place is set up as an old-school barbershop, where people want to hang out.  Total man cave.  the first thing I was asked is if I would prefer, whisky, beer or water.  I said I'm sold.  This is my new place.  I paid more than I would in my normal place but worth every penny.  Thanks people for excellent service.  I don't write reviews, but actually kept it on my to do list because they deserve it."
12/25/17,0.568125,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I had to cut my hair so I went there, very good atmosphere, you feel good, the service was executed with accuracy, very professional people here! Price is OK compared to anothers here."
12/14/17,0.234722222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"What can I say? Tony Pin is awesome. I look forward to going and seeing him give me a razor fade every week. I'm a weekly haircut type of guy. Every barbershop I have ever been to all lacked one thing, consistency. Manly & Sons know how to do barbershops. Every barber in there is professional and courteous, and they know how to cut hair. Their system works and it's easy to get an appointment. I've been to both the Echo Park shop AND here in Venice. I'm comfortable in there and it is truly an old school, men's hang out. I can have a cold beer and a cut and shave. Go see the owner, Tony. You won't be let down."
12/13/17,0.441336088,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Everyone working here is super friendly and professional. The atmosphere inside is laid back and inviting. Great conversation with Omar, he was very attentive and helpful. Ask for Angel, he cuts my hair all the time and I couldn't be happier to have him as my barber. I feel very comfortable tying new styles because I know he is very talented. Highly recommend this place, they are the best!"
12/6/17,0.457532468,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,By far the best haircut I have ever gotten. I just moved from New York and was nervous about finding a new barber but Angel put me at ease. The place is very nice and they offer you drink while you wait. Angel knew exactly what I wanted and perfected my cut couldn't be happier. Walk ins are welcome but I would suggest making appointment.
4/15/17,0.496,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Cool vibes, I like how the place is decorated makes you wanna smoke a cigar and drink whiskey. Angel took care of my beard and hair, very professional, good conversation and great results :)"
2/15/18,0.258333333,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,They do a good job here- Kelly particularly is amazing but they are way overpriced. The first time I went I was only charged $28 for a beard trim but the second time I was charged $51 for the same service with no explanation.
4/8/17,0.630194805,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"So glad they came to the Westside! I've been a fan of M&S Echo Park basically since they opened. I moved over to the West side, and they opened a new location just in time!Great vibe, great barbers, great experience. Love this place! You walk in, they give you a beer and a great haircut. Love it. Judah is the man!"
2/20/17,0.34,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been looking for a good barber/haircut in the westside,this shop passed my expectations. Second time here and I really enjoyed it. Angel was a perfectionist on detail with my haircut.Great service really friendly staff and all around a professional place. This will be my to go to barber from now on!"
3/5/17,0.463888889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Pretty much the best haircut experience I have ever had.  The staff was friendly and relaxed - just as you would want your local barbershop.  While there I had an educational conversation with my Barber, Frankie, which ran the gamer from barber techniques to the funk/soul scene in LA.  Best of all, I received an amazing haircut.All in all I walked in looking like a bum and walked out feeling like a million bucks.  Couldn't ask for anything more."

3/5/17,0.2125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"These guys are absolutely the best. I spent a while bouncing around to different barber shops looking for  good fade with good people. After several shops which just weren't my style, I landed at Manly and Sons east side shop and it was game over. I spent the next few years driving an hour each direction every 1-2 weeks just to get my hair cut by these awesome dudes. This gem is FINALLY here on the west side for us to enjoy. Same guys, same skill - I've already been 3 times and I've sent several friends over who have called me to tell me how many compliments they've gotten. Venice just came up! If I could give 6 stars I would."
3/2/17,0.4,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Definitely worth the experience, felt & looked like a million bucks after Angel was done with my hair. Phenomenal service and genuine people. Check Angel out-Manny"
12/17/17,0.139189708,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I had been getting my haircut at the original location in Echo Park pretty much since it opened. I've been meaning to swing by the Venice shop and check it out for some time, but it's a bit of a drive. I finally made it in a few weeks ago, and they did not disappoint. All the class of the Echo Park shop, but a little more dialed in and intimate. Really comfy and friendly atmosphere, free beer or shot offered as soon as you arrive. Plenty of parking in the lot behind the building. It's right next to a delicious Pie Hole! But the real star here are the barbers and the work they do. Just as good of a quality haircut as I've become accustomed to in Echo Park. The owner, Tony Pin, killed it on cuttin' up my hair and trimming my beard. I know Judah, Angel & Frankie all kill it there as well. Seems to be as consistent as their other shops, so really, I'd trust anyone there to take care of business if my go-to's are busy. They're all rad at communicating a lot with you before starting to be super clear on what you're looking to have done, which I think is key at any salon/barber shop. Honestly, I couldn't recommend this place enough. I tell all my friends that Manly & Sons is the place to go. Thanks for helping me look less ugly all these years, fellers!"
12/16/17,0.8125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best haircut I've ever gotten. Make sure to ask for Judah when you make an appointment. You won't regret it! 10 out of 10

4/16/17,0.4421875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great last minute service when Floyds messed up my appt. Cute shop with friendly barbers!
8/23/17,0.06,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I'm pretty disappointed.  I had a 7:00 appointment that started at 7:20, the guy behind me had a 7:30 appointment and didn't get in until 8:00. The location has a good old school vibe, which is exactly what I was looking for. I asked for a buzz cut with a ""1"" on the sides and a ""4"" on top. What I got was a ""1"" all the way around. Although it has a cool atmosphere, It was one of the worse haircuts I have ever received. I believe the issue is with the individual barber, not with the shop."
6/2/17,-0.018194444,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,I have been going here for about a year and I usually get a different barber every time I go. I have never had a bad cut there and the staff is down to earth which is nice since a lot of places put on a front and fail to deliver. I highly recommend this place if you want a quality cut and a fair price.
4/3/17,0.080952381,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Smaller than the Echo Park location, but with the same attention to detail and aesthetic. This is a solid barber shop with a chill vibe and great talent. Rosswell has been cutting my hair for two years, and he always keeps me looking right."
2/17/17,0.464772727,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"BEST CUT & shop EVER!!!!! I am very picky when it comes to getting my hair cut...Judah cut my hair at the new Manly & Sons here in Venice, and let me just say that I will NEVER go anywhere else. The cuts, atmosphere, customer service, and general vibe of this place is amazing!! Was on my way to Floyds but compared to this Judah at Manly...Floyds just doesn't cut it for me anymore (no pun intended)."
2/17/17,0.129687633,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Where to start about this place? easily one of my favorite places to go in LA, not only for the excellent cuts and styles they do, but for the friendship and overall vibe of the shop! I would drive clear across town to echo park to get cut at their previous shop, and you west siders know, that's damn near suicide. But It has become a place that I stop by even if I'm in the area and not in need of a cut just to say hello and chat with the boys. Judah has been cutting my hair for a number of years and I have loyally followed him to where ever it is that he is, now that he is finally in Venice I couldn't be happier. Since he has joined the talented team at Manly & Sons I have found a place that us guys can go to get fixed up proper and talk about whatever it is that us guys talk about (Thats confidential, sorry ladies). But on a serious note these guys in here have become some of my best friends in LA and have been keeping me looking sharper than ever! No matter what new style or look I'm randomly wanting to try, Judah NAILS it every single time with nothing but perfection and professionalism. I wish my hair grew faster sometimes so I had more of a reason to stop in, have a beer and hang with some of the most talented and down to earth guys in LA. There needs to be more places like this. If you have hair, and are not checking this shop out, you are doing it wrong. Say goodbye to wherever it has been that that you've been getting cut, Trust me, you will not be disappointed. Anyone who has left a less than 5 star review must have had a 1 star day before stepping into the shop, because I guarantee they left with their spirits higher and a better cut than their last.  You're welcome LA."
4/27/17,0.6625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best customer service I ever had. Very welcoming & always asks if I would like a refreshment. If you want a amazing haircut you need to get Angel to do it. Nothing but perfection from him. He'll make sure you're looking the best. Also an amazing person & gives good vibes to the shop. Make an appointment with him & you'll see how good he his.
4/8/17,0.245833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Judah cut my hair, really tip top, no nonsense..I had a floppy flimsy Mad Men Don Draper thing going on and he totally rescued it. Not easy to do with my Asian hair. Nice to be handed a beer and chill out while he worked, but he was faster than I could drink! Great cut. Great place. Thanks!"
3/10/17,0.300909091,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Wow I love this barbershop. Classy, fresh, and great vibes. Got my cut by Judah and he's exactly what I want in a barber, he takes his time and you can tell he's a perfectionist. They offered me beer and some whiskey which I took advantage of. Definitely coming back. Highly recommend. The best on the west side so far for me."
3/3/17,0.33,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Got my first skin fade from Frankie. I always wanted to try it but never felt comfortable. He did a great job and talked me through the whole process. I definitely recommend  him!
7/9/17,0.338541667,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,I followed Trevor here from another barber shop. He is the man and does a perfect fade. I would recommend getting your hair did by Trevor. The shop is also super classy and professional. This shop It has a classy and clean feel to it. Everyone is super friendly.
