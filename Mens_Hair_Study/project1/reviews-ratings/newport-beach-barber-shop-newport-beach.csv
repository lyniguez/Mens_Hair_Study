I've never EVER had a bad haircut. He washes your hair, gives you a stellar scissors cut, and even shaves your neck with foam and a straight razor. It's a comfortable and private setting that I can highly recommend. The best part is he's less expensive than all the other girlie places you typically find in the Fashion Island/Newport Beach area."
