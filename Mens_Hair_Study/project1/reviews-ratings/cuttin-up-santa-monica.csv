I got a botched hair cut and sad ""taper"" which was basically a straight line above my ears. The tapper fade on the back of my neck is uneven and their are a lot of even patches all around my head. To be honest I've had much better fades when I was in Afghanistan with crappy equipment in the middle of nowhere.I probably wouldn't come back here ever again. But I feel bad because I walked into the shop with $20's nobody had change for a $20, so I didn't tip and kind of felt bad. But she definitely didn't deserve a tip at all."

A guy was in the shop cleaning and said it would open soon but after waiting for an hour I left to do something but went back and they were open but customers where there waiting. The guy remembered me and as soon as Shanna came in they told me to sit in her chair. The best hair cut I have had since being in California about 3 months.   It was worth the wait, great barber shop, thank you Cutting Up!!"

Xavier, the proprietor, is warm, wise and a veritable Picasso with clippers. Get yourself on down here and re-live what the ""barbershop"" was meant to be!"

1/17/2016,-0.019856442577030814,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1.0 ,"To summarize, the most shocking haircut experience I've ever had. I will give the long story, but the short story is that I walked into this place and the person who cut my hair was not licensed to cut hair. I call in during the evening and ask how much and how late they're open. The man tells me to stop by, and I head over right away. I get there and it's this older man, the guy on the phone, and he promises me the best cut I've ever gotten. So I sit in the chair and he starts cutting. I like to think I have a high tolerance for pain, but that didn't matter. It was the most painful haircut of my life. My eyes watered every time he tugged and scraped against me with the machine. He even asked if I was doing alright, because he knew he had ""heavy hand"".  I sucked it up and waited for him to finish, which shouldn't have taken long since I only came in for a little bit off the sides. All the while this woman sits in the barber shop, on the phone talking to someone. In the middle of the cut she offered the man some help, which put up the first red flag. All of a sudden, a crowd of people roll out of a party bus. A boy walks in and tells the guy cutting my hair ""you shouldn't be cutting hair!!!"". That's when I started to really worry. A man walked in, and the two guys started babbling at each other. The second guy took the guys barber stuff and took over the cut. When he turned the chair, I was horrified. They started talking more while he ""fixed"" the cut. Not once did either of them apologize to me that night. They even charged me 20 bucks, and the man asked me to give it to the first guy. As I walked out the door, the first guy admitted he wasn't even licensed to cut hair. I got out of there as fast as I could. In any other situation I would've complained, but the shock of everything just made me want to get out of there. Never come here"
