3/19/2018,0.284,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,Called in for an appointment. Came in the next day and got a cut from Brian. We talked about the best cut for me to get and he even had examples on his phone of what kind of cut he was recommending. He talked me through what he was doing and how he was cutting. It took about 40 mins overall and my hair came out better than expected. Would highly recommend Brian because he is very enthusiastic and skilled.
1/19/2018,0.23012820512820517,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,"I've been to Vik's a couple times now but he earned the 5 stars way back after my first visit.  The first time I came in, I'd been meaning to clean up my look for quite a while, but I'd never gotten my hair cut by a barber prior to that.  Needless to say, for a creature of habit such as myself, it was a nerve-wracking experience, not made any better by the fact that I find my hair very difficult to deal with.  I walked in with nothing but a couple reference pictures and a shrug, fully intending to leave it to fate, but Vik talked me through the whole thing and made sure to specify what I wanted and what he'd be doing.  The cut came out amazingly, and I'd genuinely never felt better about the way my hair looked prior to that.  Walked out a different person and I've been going back ever since.All in all, Vik's a great guy and a great barber.  Cute shop, super easy to talk to, and accommodating in every way.  Real talk: I don't know if it's a common thing but being able to text your barber for an appointment is incredible."

I have extremely difficult hair for the cut I like: skin right taper w/ hard line; but Vik got it right the first time! Perfect cut. Great razor work. Reasonably priced. If i lived in the area this would be my barber.Thanks Vik!

Definitely knows what he's doing with each cut as shown by his vast array of tools and products. He does appointments only, but that's so he can take his time with each cut and not have another customer staring him down to hurry up. I've gone a few times already and was seated right away for my appointment. Fair prices for the great work done. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

He also takes his time to cut your hair. You never feel like he's rushing or disconnected. Talking to him is very pleasant and enhances the whole experience.He is able to do great fades, over combs and other hairstyles. It's a very relaxing barbershop without a crowd of people waiting . You can just sit, relax and have your nice flawless haircut."
11/18/2017,0.2008333333333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,Been going to Viks a few times now and honestly have been searching for this type of barbershop my whole life. It's just him running the shop with his wife and we always have great conversations. Barber prices are very average ($25+) would definitely recommend to friends and family. Matter fact my uncle comes with his son here. 5 stars !!!

After making an appointment, which was EASY, arrived to the shop and watched him go to work. Professional, great conversation not just with me but my son as well, attention to detail and made sure we were happy with the cut. Also gave some tips on the different pomades to use and how to properly ""train"" my son's hair. Will definitely be coming back to Viks!"
1/3/2018,0.06770833333333333,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1.0 ,"Called this barber twice, first time no answer and no voicemail. Second attempt, no answer, went to voicemail and hung up. Voicemail said to text for faster service, so I did. Did not respond back to my text. Funny thing though, it showed me that he has read my text and still couldn't respond! Now, if you were the only barber in a 100-mile radius, I wouldn't even leave a comment. However, you literally have like 2 other barbershops within walking distance. I wanted to get a haircut here because all the 5-Stars, not saying you don't deserve it, but jeez when are these barbers going to develop business skills!"

His taper and line ups were on point and exactly what i wanted. He even suggested lengths on top to match better with the shortness of my sides. Im def going back to Vick whenever im in town.

6/3/2017,0.32006493506493505,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,"I would always get the same haircut and after years decided I wanted something new with my hair. First thing was to search for a new barber. Here in Daly City there are so many barber shops, but something about Vik's shop called to me. I went in on Friday and asked if he could fit my brother an I for an appointment on Saturday. He fit us both in for 11AM. We came back the next day and he is finishing up on a customer. When he is done I go up. He immediately makes me feel welcome and at home. Its been years since I've been to a new barber so of course I was nervous, but Vik is the man, any one who is scared or nervous to try a new barber I really recommend Vik. I got the combover hairstyle I never really thought it would look good, but wanted to try it. He took about an hour on my hair he was very professional and didn't rush he took his time and made sure all parts of my hair were perfect. He then showed me the finish look and I was amazed on how awesome it looked. I loved it. Im not exaggerating in saying this is the best haircut I ever gotten. Vik got two new customers because my brother also loved his hair. Oh, and bonus points for his hospitality while cutting up my brother he gave me a soda. He did not have to do that, but he did. Thanks again Vik for your time and the best haircut of my life. Ill be back soon."
