It turned orange, then with purple shampoo turned grey/purple!I thank god found Jon Paul and he came to my house and fixed it the next day. It wasn't an easy task that's for sure! But he sure made it look easy and it looks amazing! Every time I've ever had my hair colored I never really thought it looked that great, this truly is the first time I've LOVED my hair!!! He's found a client in me for life! And I will be recommending him to family and friends. Best of all like a lot of women I have little children so the convenience of him come to my house was amazing! I even had to leave during the treatment to pick my son up from school and he said that was no problem, he just waited in hi late car reading. Very sweet and down to earth. I can't recommend Jon Paul enough. I'm very happy!!!"

Getting her up into a salon chair poses a safety risk for her in a salon, and salons are so cramped, back and forth between shampooing is just too much for her.Enter Jon-Paul. I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner! We were able to make an appointment only 2 days away, he was very communicative on how he works as well as keeping us updated on his ETA. Once he was here, he washed his hands and was all set up within a few minutes. Jon-Paul is very personable, and someone you can relate to. My grandmother loves him! We're going to have Jon-Paul come to us to cut her hair from now on, as well as style my grandmothers hair for my wedding!"

10/27/2017,0.3237719298245614,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,"After my old hairstylist moved out of Orange County , I was skeptical about finding someone else thinking my hair wouldn't look as good as before.  Gave JP a shot after reading his reviews on Yelp and I am more than happy with his services.  First of all he cuts my hair exactly the way I ask him.  Showed him a picture of what I wanted and he matches it perfectly.  Secondly, JP comes to me.  I own a business in Mission Viejo ,so it's often hard to find times to get in my car and travel.   Lastly , JP himself is a great guy.  He makes you feel comfortable, very good social skills and very informative about what I should do with my hair as far as shampoo, conditioner , product.  He has everything you need if you're looking for a great hairstylist.  I'm not a fan of giving everyone 5-star reviews but JP surely gets one for his services."

A friend of mine recommended JP being a little hesitant on a mobile hairstylist I really didn't have a choice boy was I happy that he did, he came out within an 1.5 hrs of my call and gave me the most elegant hairstyle for my event!  He really takes attention to detail.  Since then I have dumped my original hairstylist and have JP come to.my house for my monthly trim who dosent wanna be in there jammies in the comfort of there own home for a quick trim.  Thanks again JP..."

He had everything he needed to do my hair in the comfort of my own home. I felt that his prices were exceptional for the quality of work that he does, he installed my extensions as sewn in and beaded wefts and they feel secure and tight, he also trimmed and blended them into my hair to give the appearance of naturally long and thick hair. I highly recommend Jon Paul, he's fun and friendly and great conversationalist- getting my hair done by him was a blast!"

I have tried so many different types of extensions over the last few years and have never really been happy with them. He responded almost immediately after I contacted him and took the time to answer all my questions. I decided to try the I-tip extensions and I couldn't be happier! They look absolutely incredible. I'm so glad I found JP and will never go to anyone else!

But in the mix of all this I had to find a hair dresser that loves what they do and also has the experience and talent to work with long hair. Well, I was lucky to find Jon Paul!! I spoke to him on a Monday he came to see me that Saturday.Jon Paul is professional, he pretty much reaffirmed phone consult in person. He is comfortable and confident and really easy to talk to. It almost felt like we are old cousins that hadn't seen each other for year.LOLHe took before and after pictures as you can see the difference for yourself.  Now when I curl my hair it holds the curl better and it has the lift and body I have always wanted and never have been able to achieve.I don't plan on allowing any one to touch my hair, as long as Jon Paul stays in business.THANKS JON PAUL!!!!"

Jon Paul drove to my home and rescued me from leaving home in humiliation after a horrible home dye-job which turned my dark blonde hair a murky purple-grey. Somehow he was able to turn it into a beautiful blonde. At consecutive appointments Jon Paul continued to create rich highlights & saucy lowlights. Also, I love how he takes my thin hair and makes it look nice & full! His coloring is wonderful, but his cuts are fabulous! JonPaul is a gentleman & a professional. I've referred him to my mom in San Juan Capistrano & girlfriends in Newport Beach & Corona Del Mar all with happy results! I moved to Texas & unfortunately he won't move but continues to stay in The OC! I miss you JonPaul. Can I get an appointment for this August when I'm back for my school reunion?"

That was my case, I booked another hair stylist, told him exactly what I wanted: NO ORANGE, YELLOW hair, just my roots and he did just that, I looked HORRIBLE. Luckily, I found Jon-Paul and the next day he was at my door and FIXED my tragic hair.  I was praying someone could fix it immediately and not mess it up further and HE DID THE JOB! He even fixed my hair cut. Came at the time he said, set up with all the mobile items he need, easy and comfortable to talk to! Thank you so much Jon Paul - l'll see ya in 3 week ;)"

I can honestly say, my hair has never looked better since having it done by Jon-Paul. I'll never go to anyone else ever again. It was convenient, very well priced, & an over all great experience! He's the best!"
4/15/2016,0.27572150072150076,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,""" I can't say enough good things about Mobile Hair by Jon - Paul ""First off, He's a very sincere, polite & down to earth gentleman.Not only do you get an awesome hair style, which i will address later in this review,But as a bonus , you get Jon Paul's brand of "" Positive thoughts & Energy "" at the same time!"" It's like getting a haircut by Anthony Robins ""You both feel & look great along with the positive attitude to conquer the world! I came across Mobile Hair by Jon - Paul as I was combing thru the barter section of Craigslist of all places. Now, I normally don't look for hairdressers & barbers on craigslist.But when I went to his professional website to see his story & to YELP to see all the great reviews, I thought, why not? It was my girlfriend's birthday & she was bugging me for the past 2 weeks to get her hair done, which is normally a $350 bill every time. I wasn't having the best month financially so I made her wait, which is pretty much a "" NO NO "" when it comes to making your lady happy & your life easier.  So I decided to call Jon Paul for a last minute surprise cut & color at our home.He showed up on time, dressed professionally, & with a complete barber chair, mirrors & lighting set up.  It was as if we had built a salon in our living room. So to make a long story short, Jon - Paul did an exceptional job at an even more exceptional price.   He even told me to sit down in the chair at no charge so he could clean up my side burns & neckline. So if you're reading this review & wondering if you should give him a try?Do it......... & you'll be glad you did!Solid guy, solid service & solid prices.......End of story!Thanks Jon PaulK"

I don't mean that any have treated me badly, I've actually never had a bad experience. It's more that getting a haircut always felt more like a task to me; I find it comparable to teeth cleaning and oil changes. I avoid it until the heaviness of my hair give me headaches and back pains. So I dreaded when it was that time again and was shocked to find a mobile service. Jon Paul showed up and left on time, did a great job, cleaned up the mess, and is super nice. You really can't ask for more."

What a relief, but I was nervous to try a new stylist-not to worry though-John Paul is awesome.  My son needed a haircut before going back to school and he has long curly hair, been growing out for a year, he wanted to keep the length but look more styled. John paul did great job, he got here early put down his carp to cut on then his portable chair and had his cut done and cleaned up within a half hour. My son's hair looks great and I'm looking forward to booking our family with such a talented hairdresser. On a Saturday night too."

Jon-Paul is an exceptionally talented hairstylist, he gave me the gorgeous blonde highlights I have always wanted but somehow was never able to get. Jon-Paul is very attentive and so easy to work with, and his pricing is very affordable. On top of that Jon-Paul has to be one of the nicest people I have ever met.

None was as good, or as professional as Jon-Paul. Not only did he do the most perfect cut I have had in a very long time, he recommended against another more expensive treatment I said I wanted-- all to keep me from wasting my money. To have Jon-Paul arrive at my doorstep with a complete portable studio, which he set up in less than 2 minutes, was just icing on the cake. His personality is contagious without being overly verbose, the consummate professional. When you add in the fact that I cannot stand ""beauty salons"" and the noisy, ""more wine?"" atmosphere, and that Jon Paul comes to your home, ready to impress with his talents and affability, you'll never go back. I heartily recommend Jon Paul to any professionals who do not have the time, or desire to go to a salon, and who want the best hair they've ever had."
3/28/2016,0.29609988776655444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5.0 ,"JP is the most amazing ""color-fix"" expert I've ever seen! My 17yr old daughter had used store bought color to color her hair and then over time wanted to go back to her natural color. After spending 5 hrs in a salon, and a lot of money,  she came out in tears because she was given highlights and was told the process would take multiple techniques over months to get her hair looking the way she wanted. After calling the original hairdresser and not being able to get in to get it fixed, I called JP. It was a holiday and already 7:30pm. I was desperate and figured he would say he couldn't do it that night, but remember she's a teenager and did not want to go to school the next day bc she HATES highlights and that's what she had. So I texted him the whole story. He had such compassion that he said ""Yes."" He arrived to our house around 10pm. (First of all, I LOVE not having to leave my house to get a hair appt). He came in, colored it! Got rid of all the highlights and gave her beautiful, shiny hair that she LOVED!!! I would recommend him to anyone needing color, a color fix, or even just a hair cut! He also cut my other daughters hair and it was also beautiful! I have 2 hairdressers in my family who live out of state now, but this is coming from someone who knows what good & bad hair looks like. Call him if you want an easy going hair appt in your own home with a great outcome! Thanks again JP for coming to the rescue at the last minute!!!"
