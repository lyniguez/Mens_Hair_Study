2/7/2018,0.454090909090909,Positive,"My new place to go! Best service, he is the F-in homie. He knows what he is doing and i never will leave with a cut i don't think is perfect! If you haven't gone to him for a fresh cut, you are missing out. I don't see why anyone is going to anyone else. Go to him and you won't regret it at all",0
2/2/2018,0.2928571428571428,Positive,Always a fresh cut. Justin will get your hair looking right each time. Takes appointments so there's no wait time and he'll have you done before you know it.,0
10/29/2017,0.3888888888888889,Positive,"Justin did a fantastic job with both my sons. My oldest son is pretty easy to please but my 3.5 year old wanted to look like Ronaldo with a deep part and a fade. This kid has wicked curls... most hairdressers take a deep breath before working on him ! But Justin was calm, confident, and reassured my son many times that he was doing great. The result was pretty amazing. Whole family will be coming here from now on. Great prices too!",0

2/22/2018,0.43333333333333335,Positive,"Found Justin randomly a year ago and haven't gone anywhere since. Great eye for style, great conversations, and the freshest cuts. 10/10 would recommend!",0
5/22/2017,0.37088275331439396,Positive,"Been coming to Justin for about 2 years now , I moved here from New York and have been to many barbers in Orange County . He's honestly the best barber I've been to since my five year stay in California..( I've been to at least 10 different barbers before meeting Justin).. Explain to  him what you're looking for and he'll deliver for sure .  he's the only Person I would let cut my hair , I vouch for him any day ! I don't see me going to anyone else.  He once gave me a free haircut because I lost my job, great person with a good heart! Fair price cuts are very clean. Line ups are very SHARP!! Great conversation always !Trust me you would not be sorry to get a hair cut from him .",0
10/16/2017,0.5166666666666666,Positive,Nicely located within Irvine. Fade is consistent. Justin is a good guy to conversate with.,0

9/10/2017,0.17592592592592593,Positive,"Brought my son here...he has VERY difficult hair to cut and style.  Justin was great...knew exactly what to do to solve super curly hair and make it look like a great fade.  My son has had some really bad hair cuts in the past, so glad to have found Justin.  He's a great guy and love the ability to make appointments also.",0

9/3/2017,0.425,Positive,"Just moved in the neighborhood and was looking for a nice barber nearby. Saw Justin at yelp with a superb reputation. Brought my son with me and we finished like in one hour for both of us. Justin introduced us that he had experience with Asian, Afro and white hairstyles. We enjoy our great cool look a lot. Thanks Justin and carry on man!",0
7/9/2017,0.15033333333333335,Positive,"Found this place after making an awful experience at Creations Salon and Barbershop. Justin was on time and very professional the whole time. I've never trusted anyone else to cut my hair, but he did a really good job. I walked in and showed him the tapered cut I wanted from a picture I found online and he gave me the exact haircut. Justin also knew how to handle my super curly hair, something that is very rare in the OC. I will definitely be coming here in the future!! :)",0
11/28/2016,0.091005291005291,Positive,"This is Ramin. MD/MBA student. I don't enjoy bullshit or people who don't know what they're doing. Justin was dope as shit. He was the best. Super real guy, gave me a sick fade, then gave me a massage and squeezed out a few back blackheads too. I'm not even joking. Then I got some bottled water and a discount on the cut. Definitely come here.",0
6/1/2017,0.25,Positive,If you're looking for a barber that takes an account  to every detail about your hair check out Justin. He made sure that my hairstyle Matched my face shape clothes style and that I could replicate the same a look every morning before work. Justin is very easy-going attentive and dedicated to making you look and feel good. Fantastic cuts fantastic fades and all completed with a cold beer in your hand.,0
11/28/2016,0.4297619047619047,Positive,"Excellent barber and person. I just started coming to him about a couple weeks ago and I found my long-term barber. The man offers free beer (I don't drink, but great for those that do). Personable guy that you can have a great conversation with, and is clearly experienced and confident that he can and will make you look your best. I just moved here and I could not find many barbers that were used to cutting my hair (I am a black guy) so any black guys, or anyone in general, looking for an excellent barber, Justin is your guy!!",0
1/1/2018,0.38106060606060604,Positive,"Called on New Year's day and Justin was on his way out, but offered to stay until I got there. Even though I was keeping him he took the time to listen to what I was asking. $25 plus tip was a good price for a good cut with a straight razor, hot towel, and complimentary drinks.",0
1/9/2017,0.08298611111111111,Positive,"This man knows what he is doing. Understands hair and different types of cuts. Super professional!! I've had a hard time finding a barber since I'm from NY and like that east coast cut better but he hit it dead on. Let him know what you want and explain it and this dude could do it. Don't play yourself, go to Justin.",0
7/5/2017,0.4800000000000001,Positive,"Justin is a great guy to talk to; honest and has deep thought.  Gives a great haircut, just as I described.  Thanks.",0
5/15/2017,0.3049206349206349,Positive,The best barber I've ever been to hands down.  The quality of the haircut is superb and I constantly receive compliments.  Justin is also very professional and accommodating.  I highly recommend Justin for your next haircut.,0
9/11/2017,0.20083333333333336,Positive,Went and saw Justin last week to clean up my beard. Needless to say he did an amazing job! I will be making another appointment with him this week for a cut and beard trim! Highly recommend!,0
6/29/2017,0.10625000000000001,Positive,"Totally unprofessional! Does not know the meaning of customer service and would never recommend. While I was getting a haircut he literally was telling me the most vulgar sexual experiences that I had no care in hearing about, never again!",0
11/26/2016,0.05285714285714286,Positive,"Honestly Justin, I thought you were super professional driving all the way back to the shop after forgetting about my 6pm appointment. You impressed me with your apologetic manner and constant assurance that you would be back at the shop in a jiffy. However, I was pretty offended throughout the haircut from one of your comments when I asked ""Who's dog is that?"", referring to the puppy that was sitting quietly on one of the wait chairs. You responded by asking me if I wanted to eat it, which was totally unprofessional and uncalled for seeing how I am Asian and the stereotype you were trying to convey. You said you were kidding, but I didn't find any humor in your sarcasm. Of course, I played it cool. You probably know who this is now that I brought that up. As for the haircut itself, the fade was decent, but the top of my hair was cut like a buzz cut, almost as if I'm enlisting into the military. The picture that I showed you on my phone before you started cutting my hair clearly showed that the front of my hair spikes upwards and longer than the rest of the back of my head. Almost like an upward trend on a graph. I'm only writing this review because the only comments I got on my haircut were questions and concerns over the quality of the haircut itself, not compliments. It sucks when you go into a family gathering and almost everyone asks what's wrong with your hair. I'll leave it at 2 stars because the service was fast. While I appreciate a barber who takes his or her time on their client, speed is important too. As for the price, $25 for a fade is steep, regardless of the hot towel and back massage incentive. And the complimentary beer too I guess. Overall, I probably won't be coming back even though I said I would. After showering, I realized how much I disliked my haircut and it really made me sad. Not gonna lie. Maybe I just had a bad experience or maybe you were rushed to go back home since I practically called you back into the shop. Either way, lesson learned.",0
2/3/2017,0.55,Positive,Great cut. Justin knows how to cut. He can use a pair of scissors also. Definitely worth a visit,0
9/29/2017,0.22083333333333333,Positive,First time coming here got thrown off by the front barbershop in the front. I notice that he does old school flat tops. Excellent job Justin definitely coming back. Thxs,0
2/8/2017,0.34785714285714286,Positive,"I haven't had a regular barber in over 5 years, I took a shot at Justin's fade's and hairstyles four months ago and can honestly say I found my barber. Justin is not only a master of his craft but he really is a great and honest man. I'm glad I took a shot at his barber shop and I'm looking forward to having him as my barber for a very long time..",0

1/24/2017,0.18857142857142856,Positive,My son is autistic and so naturally cutting his hair can be difficult. Justin was patient and made him feel very comfortable.
