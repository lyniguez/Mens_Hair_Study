3/17/2018,0.2646428571428572,Positive,"Just went here with my fiancé on a whim because he desperately needed a haircut. We chose this place purely on the high volume of great yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. Not only is it a great ""guy feeling"" salon they have a great system that tracks all your previous haircuts with pictures so you can say ""do it the same as last time"" and they just pull up the notes and pictures. The best part in my opinion, was that the super burly dude that cut my mans hair actually took the time to teach him how to blow dry and style it himself so he could replicate it at home. I would highly recommend this place to any guy that needs a great cut.",0
3/12/2018,0.023135650581302774,Positive,"I've been getting my hair cut here for the past few months and I think it's time that I move on. I started off happy with the easy scheduling and friendly service, but the last 3 out of 4 haircuts I've had here have not been good. In fact, the last haircut I got here was downright bad. Bad enough that my wife ridiculed me for paying $40 for it, and bad enough that I'm annoyed every time I look at it. Here's why it was so bad.This location always has 4 chairs going and it's first come first serve. Two of the ""technicians"" are always very good, solid. The other two are really not very good. I've gotten the latter 2 the past few times I've come. I'm not trying to be mean, but the ""head mapping"" just doesn't work when the person cutting your hair is not very skilled. It's like giving an amateur artist some very detailed instructions, and expecting them to recreate an original drawing. My last 2 haircuts looked exactly like someone tried to trace a drawing. It was vaguely similar to what I wanted, but with no style, no technique, and plenty of uneven and missed spots. And no, you cannot request or decline a specific stylist.Honestly, I don't have time to sit there and try to fix everything that's wrong with my haircut. Even if I wanted to, how are you supposed to make it more even when it's already shorter than I want in many areas? How do you tell them to make it more even when they have been trying to make it even the whole time? I'm not even that picky about my hair, I just don't want it to suck. Unfortunately, this last one really sucked.Either way, I'm not knocking this place for what it is. It's a good place to get your haircut and they do a lot of things right. I just can't keep taking a 50% risk of getting an amateur, when I'm paying professional prices.",0
2/7/2018,0.024924242424242432,Positive,"I was excited to try this place from the reviews i saw online and the uploaded pictures. My first few times going in my haircut was amazing (it was done by the owner zac and one other girl - his second in command), however once i started getting cuts by the other stylists, i noticed the inconsistencies. My haircut started looking different and definitely wasnt amazing anymore. The last straw for me was when i got a new stylist and when i went home to take a shower, put gel in my hair, i saw a lot of uneven layers and then a major mess up behind my ear....to put the icing on the cake, that was my bday and i went out looking like an idiot. There is definitely an issue with their ""head mapping"" concept because what they dont understand is that even though no matter what stylist you go to your head shape stays the same, the perception of the stylist doesnt. everyone sees things differently and therefore no matter how many notes they take about your cut, it will translate a differently. When i wrote zac an email the person at the front desk (i believe his name is augstin) called me and asked me questions about my email (i expected the owner to reply especially since he is trying to create this business and should want to handle any issues personally) which included him telling me ""well why didnt you notice that the stylist messed up after he was done with your haircut? why didnt you say something at that time"". Unlike others, i like to go home, shower and style my hair because in the end i am going to be doing it on a regular basis and when i did do that time,  i saw the uneven cut and then the mess up behind my ear (which i wouldnt have noticed at the shop). he then said ok well i'll tell zac but unfortunately i never heard back. it was only until after i sent a second email zac called and heard me out. After i was done explaining my story, what i didnt hear from him in his response was anything like ""hey im sorry you had a bad experience, i want to make sure you are taken care of so i or (his second in command stylist) will cut your hair from now on."" Or something like ""hey why dont you come in and i will comp your next haircut and will have myself or someone monitor your haircut to make sure you get the same quality. From that point on i decided to go elsewhere for my haircut. It is unfortunate because i did like the place and the people seemed cool, yes the prices were a little high but if i get a great haircut i was ok with paying that amount.",0
4/7/2018,0.45,Positive,"Very impressed with this place. Best haircuts I've ever received. Extremely consistent even though you may never see the same barber. They have a system that allows every barber to cut your hair the same way. It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for, quality.",0

3/15/2018,0.08333333333333333,Positive,"Been coming here for a few months now. They take extra time the first visit so you get exactly what you want. Since then I've adjusted the length to match the 3 week gap between visits, now it only takes 15 - 20 minutes. I really appreciate their methodology and professionalism.",0
3/6/2018,0.4166666666666667,Positive,I've been going to Danckuts couple of times now and I love how consistent they are with their methods. I will be going there from now on and I'm so glad to have found them.,0
6/26/2017,0.13888888888888887,Positive,"Consistent. Efficient. Convenient.I care about my haircuts but I hate worrying about it! Since I started coming to Danckuts for over 2 years, I grown accustomed to the consistent level  haircuts and quick execution. And the best part, I can just schedule all the appointments in advance and never think about it outside of that again!",0
8/21/2017,0.12573529411764706,Positive,So the idea behind Danckuts is simple. You should be able to get the exact same cut you received before from any one of their barbers. If you're looking for a barber shop that's extremely entertaining and can dish out a mean cut this is the spot. I had Zac for my first cut and I can't complain at all. I walked in looking like a 3 and left a solid 8.. so if you understand how big of a difference a good cut is it's worth the price.The ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars yet is because the theory of Danckuts is to provide the same cut regardless of the barber. I will update this review with my full experience after the second (identical) haircut!,0
9/12/2017,0.021585648148148156,Positive,"The BEST haircut place I have ever been too in my life. Not only is the staff amazing, but the tech behind the haircut to have the exact same haircut every time is truly insane. Straight out of Jimmy Neutrons book and props to you Zac & the Danckuts team for the hard work everyone puts in!!",0
2/17/2018,0.2837626262626262,Positive,"My husband comes here about every 3 wks to a month for a haircut and he always comes back looking great! He used to go to 18|8 and Aveda, but he always had problems with 18|8 forgetting his appointments and what not. And at both salons it didn't matter what he told them he wanted his hair to look like because he always came back with the same cut every time and we've been together for about 9 years. Finally, I looked for a new place for him that could offer him better services and was so happy to find this place. The pricing is way better and the quality of the cut is 10x better easily - hands down! He gets compliments from his friends all the time now and the service is great. When he first went in they asked him a few questions and created his profile. They also take a photo of him after each haircut to update his profile so each person that helps him afterwards knows exactly what's going on. This place is always busy so they are apportionment only. Be sure to make one bc they don't take walk ins. Totally worth it.",0
6/26/2017,0.34896103896103897,Positive,"I haven't sweated getting a hairkut since 2012 when I started seeing Zac. To call Danckuts consistent, would be to selling short of what Zac has created. 'Replication in quality' of hair cut, service, drink service, and genuineness of every single person he employs. I've had my haircut and the pleasure of meeting many of barbers. They all do excellent work and helped me adapt my style of cut overtime. The stylist stick around after they start.. that says many things, but especially one of Danckuts reputationin general.I highly recommend making an appointment. It is a good feeling to walk into a barber shop and 100% confident you are going to walk out fresh. Thank you to Zac and Danckuts team.",0
8/30/2017,0.31071428571428567,Positive,"The best haircut I've ever had.The guy with the tattoo of barber scissors on his left arm was the one who cut my hair, he is highly skilled. He also gave me more helpful styling tips about how to use gel properly than any other barber I've been to. Totally worth the cost.",0
8/2/2017,0.30246212121212124,Positive,"Being a business owner, my image is everything to me. I recently moved to the Irvine area and got connected with Zac at Danckuts through a colleague. They take care of me there, as well as everyone I work with or train. I recommend people I know to go there all the time, and do the same to anyone looking for a new barber. The price is reasonable for the product you get. You don't go shopping for a great product and expect to pay a discounted price! It also doesn't hurt that the atmosphere there is super unique, they offer you something to drink, and always put on a smile!",0
6/4/2017,0.2449820890610364,Positive,"I felt pretty nervous before going in.      I parked my car and walked towards the entrance. Meanwhile, my heart was beating rapidly in anticipation of this haircut. I was about to go into SURGERY for my hair. I've been so used to getting $8 haircuts at the Vietnamese hair salons. Going to Danckuts was a huge upgrade for someone like myself.     I DESERVED THIS UPGRADE.      I had a feeling this was going to be a successful surgery performed by a highly-qualified hair surgeon. I kept a positive attitude throughout.     So as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a woman who checked me in and addressed me by my first name. She even got the pronunciation right on the first try! (I'm sold already at this point).     She said I could grab some beer in the back if I wanted. I said ""No thanks"".   Then, she handed me a small booklet. I opened up this booklet. This booklet contained various images of men's hair cuts. I was told to circle FOUR pictures that I liked.     Soon after making my selections, I heard the most amazing, beautiful sound.     It was the sound of my name. My hairdresser was calling me up. It was my (hair's) time to shine..   She took a look at my hair. She probably diagnosed me with thick-bushy-Indian-hair syndrome. And she would have been 100% right. ""Please make my hair look normal,"" I begged.     The hairdresser and I spent a good 3 minutes discussing my goals and preferences. Once we were on the same page, she went straight to grab my hair. And I don't blame her. It looked silky from the conditioner I just used.     She educated me throughout the process - To be honest, I am not too experienced with blowdryers. She went over how to properly blow dry the hair. (""start with the back and sides, then do the front. Don't point it straight down. Point at an angle..."").      Not only did I receive a good haircut, but I also received an education. It's a shame this kind of stuff is not taught in school.    We learn how to use a protractor..but not a blowdryer. Especially when hair helps make a good first impression, it's important to know how to use a blowdryer properly.      Overall, I'm satisfied with the way my hair turned out. My hair no longer looks like a big, thick, black mushroom. And surprisingly, I know this may sound funny, but I feel a bit more aerodynamic. I just glide effortlessly throughout my day. Ok fine - that's an exaggeration.     After the haircut was complete, they took 4 pictures of my head  4 different angles. It's the closest I've ever been to getting mugshots taken at the local jail.    I left Danckuts with a smile on my face. I'm scheduled to go back in about 4 weeks. I'm excited to see how things turn out after Round #2. Thank you!",0
5/31/2017,0.1271577380952381,Positive,"I have been to Danckuts a few times now and I gotta say, THIS PLACE IS POPPIN. The first time I was here they gave me a little book with different hairstyles in it and had me circle which ones I like, then they molded my hairstyle based on the ones I circled. Super customizable process, and the best part is I never have to describe what hairstyle I want even if get a different stylist every time. 10/10Also everyone is tight af in here shoutouts to the employees",0
6/24/2017,0.2815359477124183,Positive,"Hands down the best haircuts I've ever had. I used to pay twice as much for a haircut in NYC that couldn't match the quality, consistency, and low key atmosphere of Danckuts.When I moved out here 3 years ago, I thought I had been getting great haircuts and I was worried I wouldn't find that kind of quality in Orange County. But after reading all the reviews on yelp, I gave Danckuts a try and have been coming back ever since. Not once have I been disappointed. The rundown: the staff are friendly and fun. The atmosphere is cool without being in your face about it. No pretension, no ridiculous frills thrown on top to look fancy. It's what you need it to be: consistently good haircuts no matter whose chair you're in without hassle and with good conversations. I'd probably keep coming here until I went bald except I'm moving to SF. So now I'm just waiting for Zac to open up shop in the Bay. Give this place a shot, you won't regret it.",0

11/19/2017,-0.2333333333333333,Negative,"Went in hoping I could just sit in a chair and tell the barber exactly what I wanted, but it's not a regular barbershop. Overly complicated process from beginning to end. Also expensive as hell. Really not happy with the outcome, but I guess that's what I get for taking a chance and not going to my usual guy.",1
5/11/2017,0.305508207070707,Positive,"I've been coming to Danckuts for over a year now. I love the idea and concept. Zac and his team are great. I always leave feeling completely satisfied.I loved the old team, but had an issue with one of the new employees that started after Zac opened up his second location. I was so glad that Brittany could tell I was feeling a little distressed and checked on me and fixed what I was worried was going to be the first cut I didn't like from Danckuts. Zac even checked on me afterwards. When I responded was the cut was ""OK,"" he asked me to step outside and talk to him about it.  He genuinely cares about his business and that everyone has the best possible experience. An OK cut is not acceptable in his book.  Just that alone makes me want to come back despite one bad experience.  He turned a 2-3 star experience back to a 5 star one.Thank you, Zac! Wish you the best and hope to be a happy and loyal customer for many years to come.",0
6/16/2017,0.4838541666666667,Positive,"Danckuts is a top of the line men's hair salon with a great atmosphere and staff.  Zac is a true genius when it comes to hair design!   They have a very unique approach to styling and once you get the hair cut the way you want it, every cut in the future will be on point with their cloning system.  Super happy with my cut! Thanks Zac!!",0
10/24/2017,0.3642857142857143,Positive,"We love the place and the barbers.  My twins were very reluctant about getting haircuts.

I don't care where you are cutting your hair and how happy you are with the cuts you are getting, drop your barber, stylist, whatever, and come here. Do yourself a favor. Chances are, you never knew a good cut. The vibe here is great, everyone is friendly, respectful, and very talented. The conversations flow freely. You can't go wrong getting your haircut by anyone at Danckuts. Zac, Lorin, and Augustine have the place running like a well oiled machine!",0

I needed a haircut and was trying to find a stylist and I saw this place on yelp and  the good reviews so I tried it. Well, I have to say this place is legit. They cut my hair right and what I like the most is they have all the measurement so I don't need to explain what I want every time and it's CONSISTENT which is rare when getting your hair cut.

12/4/2016,0.44727272727272727,Positive,I've been coming to dankcuts for about 4 months now. This place is a men's Barber Shop for the new century. Above and beyond the excellent/consistent service. Their appointment booking and preference tracking is a perfect convenience. For young professionals like myself. This place is a treasure. Keep being awesome dankcuts. I'll keep coming.,0

11/8/2016,0.16338734567901236,Positive,"What a fine ass barber shop. I called in as soon as they opened today and they manage to accommodate me in an hour. The location is nothing flashy or outstandish, but that's not what makes this place so impressive.Immediately walking in, there's the sense of a friendly atmosphere, and I'm run down on how the business works. You get a small booklet of about 30+ hairstyles that you're liking for yourself. The barber is able to get a feel for what you want, not the actual hairstyle. Impressive and unique bit. Once you're done, you just chill. They have games and complimentary water/soda/beer that you can help yourself to in the back. Just wow.Once the haircut starts, the barber makes sure to ask frequently on your opinion for your hair? How short do you want the sides? Do you like your sideburns as they are now? How much do you want off the top? Want the top of your sides tighter? How're we liking it so far? After general cutting, they wash your hair for a nice minute or two (feels pretty damn relaxing) before putting finishing touches like sharpening parts of your hair and applying product. I was so impressed by how my barber helped me achieve a look I like. Also, I impulsively bought their dry hair product because it worked so well with my hair....hahaha. $35 for the cut and $20 for the product was well spent here. My hair was tailored to perfection, like a suit for myself.A few more things that made me like this place:-the atmosphere. The barbers are talking with you and the others in such a casual manner that you feel like they're friends from day 1. They're very friendly and open.-the pictures. At the end of your haircut, they take 4 pictures (back, sides, front) to make sure that if you want to replicate the hairstyle you got that day, then you can. DAMN. Although I declined to schedule another appointment within 6 weeks, I will definitely come back and schedule my next haircut HERE. This place is definitely something I don't want to miss out on. I would recommend to anyone who is in need for a haircut.",0
12/10/2016,0.25445156695156695,Positive,"So I've been going here for around 2 years now and can't believe I haven't made a review on Yelp yet! This place is honestly as good as it's going to get for a haircut and the 5 star reviews say it all. The second you walk in, you're automatically greeted with a smile and handshake welcoming you inside. They offer you complimentary beverages as well which is a nice touch. The interior look was renovated relatively recently and I love it ! It's got like a bright modern industrial look that seems to belong more so in DTLA then the cookie-cutter shopping centre it's in. Once they call you back, they'll take you through the whole process of making sure you're getting the perfect cut every time no matter which one of them cuts your hair. (You tend to rotate between all of them throughout your different appointments). They really have a way of knowing exactly what you want and offer great suggestions for those of you who are more on the indecisive side like me! After the cut, they'll rinse off your hair and then blow dry and apply product to your hair!  It truly is a unique experience here in that they write down everything they do in Ipads to make sure you get the same quality cut every time. You also get pictures taken of your cut at the end to replicate it the next time.  All of the staff here are incredibly chill and all of them give a stellar cut! It's a very relaxed and casual vibe with them. Cuts are around $35 which isn't bad at all considering the quality cut you get! Make sure to make an appointment ahead of time because they most likely won't have any available on the day of unless someone cancels. Really didn't realise how much I enjoy this place until I left the country for a few months and no cut could even come close to this place! Totally recommend !!",0
3/31/2017,-0.021428571428571425,Negative,"After three haircuts here, I decided that the concept just doesn't work, at least for me.  The concept that your hair can be cut the same way every time regardless of who is cutting your hair sounds wonderful but in all practicality I think it is difficult to repeat.  You will find similar comments on this from others.  All three of my haircuts were different.  They were not only different but the technique each stylist used was different.  That was a tell tale sign that there is a conflict between their concept and training.The shop seems nice and professional but you can read between the lines based on the open conversations they have while cutting your hair and the offensive sign they have on the ceiling while your hair is being washed.",1
7/14/2017,0.12151253918495299,Positive,"I heard about this place through a friend when it was a one man show several years back. I never followed through on an appointment due to where I lived until recently, and was initially excited. However, I left a little disappointed after both visits. After the first time I got a cut here, I went home and scanned it, and didn't like the length. On top of that, the texturizing was very substandard. I went back for an adjustment but it was more or less the same; just shorter. On my next visit, I got a decent haircut and it was styled nicely. But when I got back, it was cut in a way that I was not able to style it as well since my blow dryer isn't as good as theirs. I don't live that close so I opted to just suck it up. These experiences made me realize how much better it is for me to build a relationship with just one stylist; and you can't do that at Danckuts. Don't get me wrong, their system sounds good in principle, but a system that efficient should not cost $35! Look, it may very well work out for you, but until they train their barbers to improve their technique and add to their repertoire, I just can't justify how it's worth the $35 bill. I would encourage you to give them a shot at least once, and see if you get a better experience than me.",0
11/8/2017,0.2484848484848485,Positive,"The so called patented haircut process is garbage. In theory it sounds cool to be able to go in and be guaranteed the same haircut by any barber. However, it never looks the same - or slightly close. The shop itself is rad (yup I just took it back to the fourth grade and used the word rad) and the employees are all really cool but what Zack try's to sell you on is a lie. No offense Zack, but if we're being honest the haircut process that you sell doesn't work. You run a cool trendy haircut business but the haircuts you guarantee are a ripoff. Cheers!",0

I have even gone to a couple of those expensive salons you find in OC ( sassoon salon, etc) and i am very pleased from the work done here at danckuts.I was immediately greeted by the owner Zac, pretty chill guy. He explained to me how everything worked and how they go about their cuts. They really do live up to the name ""Hair Engineers"" theres more of a science to how and why they cut. I believe it is an appointment based shop so there was little to no wait time, and the shop wasn't packed with people waiting.The guy that cut my hair knew what he was doing, he explained everything in detail BEFORE we had even started. I would rate my overall experience a 9/10. Although I am a little skeptical about how they set up who cuts your hair. traditionally I would ask for the same guy for my cut, but they take a few pictures of your hair and leave detailed notes about the cut, So the next person will cut your hair exactly the same. I scheduled my appointment for my next cut and we'll see how that goes. But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone.",0

Everyone working there is awesome and they really take the best possible care of you and ensure you that your haircut is EXACTLY the way you want it to be. I showed up there at around 6:50 pm and they were closing at 8 pm and they STILL ended up taking me in at 8:45 to help me out with my messed up haircut. I would HIGHLY recommend you stop by this place because I know 100% I will be going back very soon. You guys are awesome!,0
6/13/2017,0.3014285714285715,Positive,Great haircut and atmosphere. Would highly recommend. Really like the concept of taking pictures so you can modify your haircut next time or just get the same exact thing. Fairly priced as well,0
1/31/2017,0.2294642857142857,Positive,"I've been there multiple times! They do a great job! But the problem is that I prefer one barber to work on my haircut and they do not provide that! My last haircut was perfect with no mistakes not even a tiny one! And when I came back the next time I asked for the same haircut and the result was something totally different! I texted them about it and my request wasn't possible! They said that Appointments are given on a specific time and the barber who's free at that time will work on the haircut, that is how the system works! And they offered a fix up for free but that's not what I asked for!Unfortunately, I'm not going to be returning to this place and I really recommend having appointments based on the barber not just the time! Nothing can't be changed!",0

I personally liked the shop better before the remodel. It seems with the remodel the staff was also switched around...  I had a good run! I even followed them to the temporary space they were renting while they were remodeling.Though the mapping they do and the pictures they take should help to have the same haircut every time it seems to have really differ from person to person. Since they prefer that you do not request anyone I kinda stopped making an effort since I was getting a different haircut every time the last 2 months I was coming here. Do not get me wrong, great haircuts, just no consistency. Overall, Great haircuts, They raised the price on me all of a sudden which was not a big deal until the switch.. Friendly staff, great music playing all the time... why not 5 stars? I feel like it is a completely different shop and no consistency the last couple of months",0

A few of my friends told me about Danckuts and I was hesitant after hearing about their hair ""engineering"" and $35 price tag.But I gave it a shot and I am so happy that I did. Zac told me everything I was doing wrong. He told me why my hair did not have any volume to it and he explained it all the way down to the science of my hair follicles. Zac told me how to style my hair and what products to use and what products I should not be using. It really was the best haircut I have ever had and it is worth every penny.Also, it is a really cool environment.

11/8/2015,0.24940104166666666,Positive,"I've been wanting to try this place for some time now. I know that trying to do the ""walk in"" thing doesn't work but I was driving around the area one Saturday morning & decided to ""pop in"" anyway. So as I expected they didn't have anything readily available but they had the next day in the afternoon so I jumped on that opening. I want to first start off by saying I dig the inside shop itself, I love the dark, gothic look of the decor. Reminds me of the movie, ""The Equalizer"" when Denzel walks into the Russians mobs upstairs bar! Love the back bar area! I have short hair to begin with so I was thinking how much better can the cut be, honestly? Well honestly........A LOT!!!!! I'm horrible with names when I first meet people so I can't remember the girls name but she had ""pink"" hair! She was super nice, very very thorough about how they cut hair & I felt very comfortable with her suggestions. My wife has a very honest approach when it comes to judging stuff like this & the last place I went she said, ""Did they even cut it""??? LOL! This time she said, ""Wow they did a great job""! So that was enough for me!I don't give a lot of 5 stars but they deserve it. I like the ""tech"" way they approach everything from the haircut itself to payment. Price........well......since I'm used to cutting my own hair I don't think I'll ever get used to ""todays"" prices especially for cutting men's hair but then again you can't put too much emphasis on price when the end result is close to perfect as your going to get! So I'll chalk this up to one of my rare ""once a month"" treats I'll give myself. Yeah I'm a fan for sure.",0
7/4/2017,0.1358974358974359,Positive,"Decent, but not great!!!!! I guess I'm one of those who is of the opinion that a place will only offer a full NO questions asked refund if they can't stand behind the quality they offer. I'd rather pay more, be guaranteed to get a quality result than be scared they might screw it up and be offered my cash back or the offer to fix the issue. It might be worth a visit for some, but I'm happy to go back to my regular place knowing I'm getting a great cut, service and not more concerned with the policy they have to cover their themselves",0
1/30/2017,0.16201298701298705,Positive,"I believe the price would be reasonable if they were more focused on cutting your hair rather than talking and sounding smart by using their own haircut terminology. I went in thinking.. wow they must really know their stuff by the way they sweet talked to me. They gave me tips on what hair I should get and why I should get it. That's fine if they do that, but I already knew what haircut I wanted. Although this was my first time there, I always get the same haircut every time anywhere I go. So as I explained what I wanted, they would not listen to me and kept trying to convince me otherwise.. assuming that I didn't know what I wanted or didn't know what I was doing. Also, they talked for half the time of my haircut. Plus it hurt every time they were shaving the sides of my head. They used very forceful and quick movements to shave my hair off which hurt.. but they did put on a good show acting like they knew what they were doing. Towards the end, I wanted something else of my haircut fixed but they suggested and seemed impatient to let me get my haircut fixed since it took over half an hour. (Which by the way.. half the time was because of them talking about the night they had before) This place isn't as nice as it seems.",0

3/13/2016,0.22266746411483257,Positive,"I barely write reviews anymore, but I had the most awesome experience at Danckut's ever. Today is my birthday, and they really made me feel special.For a while, I've been getting haircuts at random Asian salons or Hair Academies, both of which are okay. For a $10 haircut, it doesn't get much better than that. What I dislike about both aforementioned establishments is that the stylist/barber does not really understand ""forward"" haircuts. If I wanted a simple haircut with spikey hair or a faux hawk like every other dude, then $10 hair cuts would do.For the longest time, I've wanted to have a certain hairstyle that I was not even sure my hair could do. I work in the fashion industry, not that it matters much, but I guess what I'm implying by that is that I really like ""forward"" haircuts. I've heard NOTHING but great things about Danckut's and after a few mishaps on my end (ie: Driving to the wrong location and waking up super hung over the day after my birthday therefore missing my original appointment, it was finally time for my appointment.Unless I was trippin' from being overly excited, I think I heard Ty$ right when I walked in the door. To top it off, the receptionist Alexa was super dope and friendly. To make it cooler, she had Yeezys on.Hailey cut my hair and was super dope. The ""generic"" photos they let you circle on a laminated sheet are ALL trending hair cuts that I've been dying to have, but have always struggled finding a stylist who understand how to cut that hairstyle.30 minutes into my haircut, I'm in love with the whole vibe, the team, and obviously my hair. I love boutiques, and this hair shop reminds me of a boutique. Everyone vibes with each other and the team is more than a family than a team.I never paid $35 for a haircut before, but now I will go to Danckut's, even if it's out of my way (I live in LA now). The experience was so rad that I even bought the hair product, brush, and hair spray.Maybe I'm just hyped because it's my birthday, but there is a great reason why everyone gives Danckut's 5 stars. And if they don't , it's rad knowing that they will do anything they can to either 1) explain the situation or 2) make things right.Thanks guys for being one of the joys on my birthday day.",0
1/10/2016,0.25459401709401713,Positive,"I don't often give many reviews on Yelp, but after my experience, I felt a review was the least I could do to give my gratitude for my experience!Best haircut I have ever had, hands down. Had an awesome opportunity to squeeze in for an appt. at 10am on a Sunday and had my haircut done by Zach. First off, as I entered I was greeted with a firm handshake, a smile and a coffee, which that alone won my respect and business. I'm very picky about who I get my haircut by and ever since I moved to Irvine from Vegas, I've been searching for a place to get the job done. Zach and the team were so very personable and warming. Amazing conversationalist and genuinely interested in his clients. I too, have to be very personable in my profession so I look for that in other people who provide services as well. And Zach was nothing short of that. I've had two brain surgeries back when I was 16, so sometimes it's difficult finding a hairstyle that matches the shape of my head and something that flows. I left their so abundantly satisfied. But the technique and time they put into your cut and the style you want is worth it. I value people who take their time in their craft and value their own work. They don't try to hustle people in and out of the chairs and make sure you had the best experience possible. This review doesn't give it justice on how amazing the quality of the cut was and experience I got to enjoy. Please, try and get in their if you're looking for top quality and a barber that truly cares about his clients.",0

He has even created a patented haircut. What they do is ask a lot of questions, study your head shape and hair type, and figure out what it is you're looking for. Once the cut is done, they take pictures of front back and sides, and make notes about your cut. The next time you show up, they review your file and your last cut and if that's what u liked last time they have a perfect reference to replicate the same cut. Their goal is to provide you the best haircut you ve ever had. Every time! Id say they do pretty good accomplishing that. Oh yeah, the Tvs and complimentary beer isn't a bad deal either.",0

Always consistent and never a complaint about the final result, regardless of the actual person you get.My fiancé complains about the dollars spent since I come once every 2-3 weeks.

I am very meticulous about people cutting my hair and couldn't have gone to a better place. Danckuts is nestled in the back of a shopping center, so don't feel alarmed if you feel you reached the wrong destination when your GPS leads you there. It is the best place for a haircut by far. When walking in the door as a first time customer you will instantly feel welcomed as a ""regular"". I think it's pretty cool they were able to offer a drink when waiting for your appointment and their interior decor was far out!Their professionalism is greatly noticed when greeted or taking the time to listen for specifics in what you are trying to achieve with your hair. I am definitely coming back! Quick tip make sure you phone in advance because spots can fill up quick especially around the holidays.",0
8/16/2015,0.24794238683127573,Positive,"Went in for a cut about a month ago-- never got around to writing a review.This place is great. Their process for a first timer: They give you a sheet with 20-something different cuts, have you choose a few that look good, then have a conversation about why you chose what. From there, you narrow it down based on your head/face and hair pattern, and then they take notes/measures/pictures of your cut.All of the info is stored in their database, with the idea being that, if you like your cut, you can get the exact cut again. If not, they have a base to work off of in deciding what to change. I had the pleasure of talking with one of the founders, and we covered various parts of his business idea, talked about the history of the barbershop/mens haircuts and associated trends. He struck me as ambitious and with good business sense.I loved the haircut I left with. My only thought, which we discussed during the cut, was whether the barber should have more input on the cut a customer gets. Their process, in my experience, is very customer-driven. You're choosing the styles and determining which parts of what you like. And while I think it's definitely important for the consumer to like their cut, I think it's also a good opportunity, during the discussion, for the barber to provide input based on their experience .Still, there's a good argument going both ways. Customer choice vs professional expertise will be something they'll work out over time. For me, it's a place I'd recommend to everyone who wants to eliminate the uncertainty in getting a good cut. Also good to find a place where you can share a brew with you barber.I'm now back on the east coast, but hey, if they open up branches out here, I'll know they have my cut up and ready to go.",0

Where I'm originally from (Midwest area) there aren't many high quality barbershops and to be honest I'm not familiar with hair maintenance, but on my first visit they really take care of you and make you feel comfortable.

12/9/2015,0.14453125,Positive,"Since my hair grows at an insane rate, I am free to endure a multitude of terrible haircuts (and I have). With that said, I have encountered many different types of hair stylists, internalized the codex, and have learned to adjust to any hairstylist by imparting terms so that I can get the 'same haircut'. While there are mishaps here and there, it has never been a major issue. However, in my reflection, I've recognized that I've never been truly satisfied with my haircut - that was until Danckuts. Danckuts has made an exquisite impression on me. They are transparent in the haircutting process, allowing you to provide input whilst getting your haircut and at the same time, is willing to cultivate your understanding as to why there are limitations or why they are doing what they're doing. There is a clear sense of communication and professionalism. At the same time, each member demonstrates drive to be the best in what they do.

The way they keep track of your cut with pictures and notes means you always get the same cut no matter who cuts it, which is great for scheduling. Their text-based appointment reminders are also invaluable for people with busy schedules who have a hard time fitting in the time for an appointment. Very highly recommend them!",0

I'd also been going to Baxter Finley for a while when I was living in LA but their prices are too damn high.My hair was gettin long so one night i randomly typed in 'barber' on Yelp and saw 'Cratchit Danckut's' and immediately started laughing out loud. I already knew I was gonna get my haircut there the moment I saw that name. What an awesome name dude. Called them the next morning and the rest is history. Everyone working there is super cool. Agustin, Zac, Lorin, and Hailee always make for good conversation and great haircuts. They have a special system in which they store details on each haircut they give you so every time you come in theres no confusion on what you want done to your hair. Because of this system, everyone working at Danckuts can give you the exact haircut, every time. Except Agustin, who never cuts my hair, just offers me beer.

They have a technical way of cutting hair which allows the quality of their cuts to remain consistent each visit no matter who is cutting your hair (They've expanded their staff to 3 now).  Pairing this method with their system/app that records and stores pictures from past appointments, and its practically impossible to get a ""Bad"" haircut from here.  The shop itself is great too! Ambiance is cool, you can get a free drink, watch TV, ect.  Usually they run pretty on schedule so there isn't a ton of waiting around.  The only hesitation I had before trying Danckut's was the price point.  I've always spent around $15-20 for a haircut so spending $35 seemed excessive.  But after a couple visits and many compliments I can safely say, at least for me, that the extra $15-20 is worth it.   All in all it's just a fun, pleasant experience overall.  Highly recommend! Just make sure to book an appointment several weeks in advance.",0

I have searched for three years trying to find a solid barber shop in/near Irvine and this place is the only place i trust!! It's an all-around awesome experience and quite a few guys from my Fraternity are regulars here too, I'd highly recommend giving it a shot! It is a bit on the pricy side ($35 a cut) for a broke college kid like me, but I still find the price to be justified due to the quality. I do sometimes miss the straight razor & beard line ups that some other barber shops offer, but with cuts like these, i'm not complaining!",0

Had to head out before my cut to keep my work schedule. This is the second time I've had an appointment there and had to wait 25 plus min past my scheduled time and I've only had two appointments.   They do a good job once you're in the seat, but they need to do a better job with scheduling. It's ironic that they put such an emphasis on making sure you keep your schedule with them (with emails and texts), but it hasn't been reciprocated the only two times I've been there.  If I go back it will have to be on a weekend or after work. Can't afford to waste more of my time with appointments that aren't kept.",0

It seemed that the whole team was assembled.The first thing I noticed when i entered the place is this AMAZING buttery egg croissant smell on that lovely Saturday morning, which made me instantly hungry.  I thought it was fine, cause hey it's was early and you know what? Everyone has to have some breakfast ( just didn't expect that delicious whiff of food coming out of a hair cutting place).Matt greeted me and offered me some coffee, everyone was super nice and attentive. It took Matt about 15 minutes to get me my coffee cause he needs to be trained on how to use that complicated coffee machine!Next up was the this nice girl called Brittney, she was really cool and sold me on the whole Danckut method, and educated me on the technically correct terms of some of the cuts.She took her time to cut my hair, listened, and I ended up getting a great haircut.I would definitely go back again, and will change my review to 5 star, if and only if Matt learns how to use the damn complicated coffee machine! so you have 3 weeks buddy, 3 weeks to learn... hahaha",0

They are very good at listening to you and make sure they understand the look you are going for before getting started. They also taylor each style of hair to your particular head and shape. Finally, what i felt made Danckut's stand apart from all other barbers was their knowledge of hair and styles, and how to achieve a particular look for everyone. They will coach you techniques to make your hair cooperate. And lastly, they document every little thing they do and take pictures at the end so that any stylist can accomplish the same look in future visits. I will definitely be going back!",0

I've been coming here for quite some time now and I've always been impressed with the end result. Zac and Loren are both amazing at what they do. I started getting my cuts done from Zac and Loren both do an impeccable job at paying close attention to detail and gives you exactly what you want in terms of length and style. The way they cut is truly one-of-a-kind. As soon as I step into the store, I'm greeted by Agustin and asked if I want water or beer. (They have beer on tap).As soon as I sit, Zac or Loren already know exactly what I want using a database where they save everyone's cut. My hair is cut exactly the same way every time and there is no change in consistency. This is what makes a good barbershop, in my opinion. Zac has perfected his craft and I can trust either of them with my hair.Prices are reasonable and customer service is excellent.

4/29/2015,0.1017838246409675,Positive,"Very impressed by this place.  The owner, as well as the employees take their jobs very serious while making you feel very comfortable in a laid back setting (which I find to be a difficult line to walk).  The shop itself is a bit hidden on the corner of Yale and Trabuco.  Go around the back and look for their signage.  Upon entering, I was greeted by two men behind the counter.  They asked for my appointment and I gave them my info.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize that my appt wasn't actually scheduled until the following day.  Noticeably disappointed (at the fault of my own) the owner offered a few different options to help accommodate me.  I really can't stress this enough- I love when people take themselves out of their ""this is how we do things"" attitude and just try to find a solution however that may be achieved.  Very impressive trait to have in the business they're in.  I wish I could simply call this a haircut.  It really is an experience.  Something that sets them apart from other barbers I've been to.  They quite literally have hair down to a science and translate it to you in a way you'll understand.  Why do I hate barbers?  Because I don't know what the hell I want.  I want my hair to look good.  Danckuts will walk you through the options without making you feel like an idiot for your lack of knowledge on the subject (unlike a lot of other barbers).  So the cut itself.  Amazing.  I felt like the barber and I worked together to ultimately achieve my perfect cut.  Throughout the cut he would ask how I felt about the length etc.  Again, making me feel very comfortable and in turn, much more informed.  And on to my favorite part.  They actually take pics and electronically catalog the cut that worked for you.  I will again never have to explain to them what I want.  It's all been catalogued and I can simply say, "" same thing as last time.""  Cheers Danckuts!!

It had a feeling of an mid-century modern furnishings. The first hair stylist gave me the haircut that I liked, and suggested how best to style my hair, due to my hair length and head structure. The second time I went, I had a haircut with Zac (the owner). He went overall how my previous cut was and did his best to go above and beyond and do a more detailed job with me.

He keeps a particular look and feel to the place, from the decor to the offered beverage refreshments. After asking you for what kind of hairstyle you want, he walks you through what he will do to your hair and why. As many people have mentioned, he is the only hairstylist there so it's hard to get an appointment, but he told me he's going to hire a couple more guys in the near future. I for one think it is very prudent business-wise to start small, and control the growth. I've seen a lot of businesses get too excited and over expand too quickly at the expense of quality.edit: came back after a couple months. Zac is training another haircutter! Her name is Lauren I believe, and he's training her to cut to the same standard as himself. Look forward to being able to come here more frequently",0

I ended up paying $35 + $7 tip (20%)--a little inconsistent with the website. This is the ONLY reason why I took off one star, but should not be overlooked.I walked in with a small idea of how I wanted to cut my hair and Zac turned it into a reality with a long term plan. Granted, men's hair doesn't get as complicated as the opposite sex, but still his methods are more systematic than other places I've been to before. After my cut, I was surprised (in a good way) that I was able to schedule out my hair appointments for the rest of the year. That definitely beats the 11-week wait they currently have.I would not recommend this place to anyone because I don't want them to screw up this wait list for me--I joke.

BUT Zac is great, yeah you know that already.The other day I got my dates mixed up and had to miss my first appointment in the two years he's been cutting my hair. Normally I know that means waiting an extra month, but Gus got me in with Lorin and she did a fantastic job. I've been coming here for a while and Zac has told me that even when they add cutters, he'll still probably need to do my hair because of the complexities of the cut as well as how curly my hair is. Lorin had no problem matching his work exactly. Now hopefully more people can get in here and have nice hair. I recommend this place to everybody all the time.",0
4/3/2014,0.22193452380952378,Positive,"I had been bouncing around for the better part of 15+ years, from salon to barber shop, trying to get a very specific haircut. Usually, in the last four years stylists would come CLOSE, but they'd always fall short when it came to fading the back of my head (simple task I'd have thought) or they'd have some moral dilemma leaving my bangs longer. I saw Cratchit Dankut's reviews and photos and just knew that this was where I needed to get my hairs cut. I was added to the magic waiting list and (relatively) patiently waited for my spot to come up. It was a while, but finally, there was a light at the end of that tunnel; that light's name is Lorin. Before singing the many praises of Lorin's skilled clipper & scissor work, I should first explain the ease of explaining your desired cut ONE TIME & ONE TIME ONLY!  I fumbled around with the words for the look I was going for, explaining what I wanted/didn't want. Not only did both Lorin and Zack understand my lame attempt at describing the desired effect, but Zack looks to Lorin and says, ""What would you do?""  She goes off on all of the technical aspects of what my haircut is called then digs in. 50 minutes later, I have the haircut I have been trying to obtain for close to two decades! Lorin has nailed it, and has continued to nail it every two weeks since. The only things I'm ever asked before my haircuts now is if I'd like a drink, how I'm doing or if there is ANYTHING I'd like to change. Augustine, Zack and Lorin are exceptionally friendly and personable, the music that is played in there is pretty damn good (got some Beck, Strokes and Black Keys last night). The decor is nice and rustic with the right amount of modern accoutrements (if you're into knowing that sorta thing). The barber chairs are super comfy, which is good because both Zack & Lorin take their time to make you look great. Most importantly though, every haircut that I've seen walk out of there is pretty killer. People look like they have had their hair cut professionally. Zack is well on his way to becoming the Vidal Sassoon of the barber world (that is a good thing - in case you are young and don't know)",0

3/24/2013,0.11986111111111111,Positive,"This is the first Yelp review I've ever written and how appropriate that it would be for one of my favorite establishments. First off, this review is extremely overdue. I've been going to Zac for about five months now and every single time I have never been disappointed. In fact, each time I left happier that the last. This is really comforting for me because before going to Zac I've been in search for the right barber for years now. The search was a long and arduous one since the number of barbers out there who can cut an asian guy's hair well seems to be incredibly small. But, Zac put a rest to my search. After Zac cut my hair the first time, I realized that his acute attention to detail and his impeccable skill was uncommon for such a young barber. I knew that I would be coming back. And not to mention that in addition to throwing in a free beer with your cut, Zac is a really down to earth dude and a great conversationalist; I was sold. On my next visit, I mentioned that I was bored of having the same fauxhawk for the better part of the last decade so Zac suggested that I try a combover. After a month or two of growing pains and with Zac's guidance, my combover is now ridiculously awesome and I've never been happier with my hair. I mean just peruse through his photo album and look at the wave of dudes receiving perfect combovers from Zac-- it speaks for itself. So, word to any asian dude out there bored of their hairstyle, or regardless, if you're just  looking for a reliable barber, Zac is definitely your man. I mean 43 straight five star reviews can't be wrong, right?",0
8/1/2016,0.19334415584415587,Positive,"So I've recently moved from the East Coast where I'm used to top notch barbers who can and will cater to your preference while adding their two sense based on their skills and experiences. After reading mostly all the great reviews, I decided to give Danckuts a try since I have had a few trial and errors with previous haircuts resulting in the realization that West Coast cuts differ from the East Coast. But well...that was a mistake. Don't let the free beer/beverage enticement fool you... The barber that I ended up was pretty average but knowledgeable in his cuts. The problem lies that they have this ""detailing system"" or whatever they call it in which they guarantee that you will get the same hair cut every time you come. But it's based off a template of haircuts that you are able to choose from. I told the barber that I wanted a certain hair cut style which requires my side burns to be shaped a certain way assuming that it would be no problem. But my barber replied with a ""sorry can't do it"" with the reasoning that not everyone was able to shape my side burns that particular way even though he himself was able to. I looked at him and was like.."" so you're saying that I'm paying you for a haircut but I can't get it the way I want?"" He seemed a bit flustered but then proceeded to ask the owner if it was okay...after finally getting the approval, he proceeded to accommodate my request. Not to mention overhearing the person next to me complaining about how his hair was way shorter than what he originally wanted and described to his barber. All in all, it was a sub par experience and certainly not worth the price. You would have better luck searching elsewhere that will give you the service you deserve for the price you pay for.",0

I usually go to Floyd's, but even so, my haircuts have been inconsistent for the obvious reason.You may be looking at the reviews and wondering what could Zac possibly do to earn this reputation. If you're skeptical, just go and see for yourself. This place is great and I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else to get my haircut. This place has struck the perfect balance of having a place where a guy can feel comfortable without being over-the-top or pretentious. Zac is talented and he's great at his craft. He doesn't just cut hair, he give it style. I wen't in just to clean up my hair and was expecting that I'd come out with what I had before, but more neat. What I came out with was a much better look than when I went in beyond it just being more neat. Yes, the place is nice. Yes, they offer you drinks. Yes, guys can feel right at home. But what really sets this place apart is Zac and his staff. They simply provide great service, but in a very real and genuine way. Needless to say, I'll be getting my haircut here from now on.",0
2/5/2016,0.21904545454545457,Positive,"For the most part I really enjoy getting my haircut here. I only had one experience where I thought my haircut was a little subpar but every other time I was extremely happy with the results. All of the barbers are friendly and fun and it really seems like they love what they do. There is a bar within the shop and they will offer you a drink or water or coffee which I think is pretty cool. My only real complaints are the price and the fact that you can't pick which barber you get. When I questioned them about this they claimed that they document the haircuts and ""engineer"" them all the exact same so it doesn't matter who you get. Now in a perfect world or if we were all robots then this would be true but unfortunately this is not the case and in reality we are all human. With that said some barbers are noticeably better than others at the shop. But like I said my over all my experience here has been quite positive and as long as you can afford the extra cost I would recommend this barber if you live in the area.",0

1/4/2013,0.23641975308641977,Positive,"Cratchit Danckut was sort of hard to find. It's located in the AG Lounge for Hair, and just ask the front desk lady that you have an appointment for Zac. Appointments are super easy, he accepts calls and texts! Usually Yelp reviews are misleading because it's all just one huge circle-jerk sometimes, and a lot of places are truly overhyped (mostly restaurants though). Some people rate the establishment only because of its service. Other people rate the establishment only because of its product (in this case, the haircut). Zac, however, is an exception; he excels in both of these areas. You see all these reviews below me? Those are 27 CONSECUTIVE 5 Star Reviews. That says something. Like what Bryan C. said, Zac spends a lot of time and pays a lot of attention to detail for your haircut (he spent 40 minutes buzzing my friend's crew cut! That's next level attention), letting you know what he's doing step by step. He really know what he's doing and tries his best to give you the look you want. If you need to drop by for a quick haircut or something, I wouldn't really recommend here because it seems like Zac actually takes time for your haircut even if there are customers waiting after you. This guy is genuinely nice, super chill, and super focused on his work. He can cut hair for men of all ages. His cuts are reasonably priced. All his pricing and services are listed on the website, and you can get a free drink (wine, water, beer, soda). Maybe this is my first time, or maybe because I'm a college student, or maybe because I'm not in California most of the time, but it was really nice of him to give me a discount for my buzz-fade-sidepart-whatever you call it-cut. So thanks Zac! Bottom line:-Reasonably Priced-Good guy-Detailed haircut- Well worth the hype.",0

8/2/2015,0.28954545454545455,Positive,"I've been to many barbershops in my lifetime, and have never been more impressed with the consistent excellent results then with my experience at Danckut's.  The owner, a young entrepreneur by the name of Zac Reese, has redefined the barbering business.  He has staffed his establishment with several well trained hair techs.  They are trained by him to all follow the same blueprint, yielding identical results no matter who the customer is.  This state of the art barbering establishment uses a scientific approach to haircutting.  They make note of every customers preferred cut, thus enabling any one of their hair techs to replicate the identical haircut on any customer.  When you are about to leave after making payment, Agustin, the young man in charge of scheduling and cashiering, and I'm sure many other more mundane tasks, takes digital images of the results, front, back, and sides.  Did I mention that when scheduling an appointment (good luck with that) you cannot specify which hair tech you prefer, it's a random thing.  That is unusual one would agree, but since all of the hair techs are trained to replicate any cut on record, there is no problem with that methodology, right?I have had my hair cut by all of the hair techs over the years I've been a loyal customer, and the results are very close each time.  Most of the clientele are young millennials, and I am probably the most senior customer I would guess.  I have probably had more haircuts over my many years on this planet than most other Danckut customers, and feel that I am well qualified to review this growing establishment.  If you seek a very nice haircut, and want to meet Zac and his super friendly and skilled staff, reach out to them today and schedule an appointment.  You won't be sorry you did.",0

I had a stylist for seven years, a year ago I wanted to switch it up, I found Zac. It was a match made in hair heaven. In 33 years of living I've never been as happy with my style & cut then now. So pristine, tight, and customized.

It was my very first time and I made an appointment but when I got there in time, I have to wait almost 20 freakin' minutes. Also, the person who cut my hair, Lauren, was all talk but at the end I was with a cut that was at best something from a SuperCuts. She didn't even friggin' grab a mirror and let me see how the back of my head turned out. Plus, I has some long sideburns, and she didn't even care to ask if I needed them shortened. She even professed to be overworked at this barber shop and said that she is not allowed any breaks on Saturdays and works a straight 8 hour shift. The owners of this place must be from North Korea or somethin'. Plus, the vibe from this place is so pretentious and hipster doofus-like that I feel like I needed a pair of super skinny jeans to fit in. What you are paying premium for in the cost of the haircut goes to the liquor license for the pseudo bar in the back. Who in the heck would truly be drinking hard liquor on a Sat morning anyhow? Do they even card these kids that come in asking for a double scotch? Plus, the barber chairs are way too close to each other for comfort. I mean, I do not want to hear every friggin' word that the other customers are saying to their respective barbers. It's annoying, and I did not pay a premium cost for a cut to be listening to how to properly have a bowel movement. Yes, that what I heard the other barber passing out a tip to the customer of how to take a sh*t properly. All in all, not worth the $35 to first have to wait (isn't that what appts are for people?), then hear a spiel from Lauren about how she will fondle and measure my skull and utilize a few advanced mathematical equations to come to a proper cut for me. And to add insult to injury, they take digicam mugshots of your head after the cut so that they have a proxy of how mediocre it was so that they can replicate it later? ""FREE"" hard liquor, natural selection spiel on the evolution of head shapes and how it equates to a scientific methodology in hair-cutting, feeling rushed and listening to your barber complain about having no breaks, listening to irrelevant conversations earshot from your chair, appt time that is not met - all this equates to NO return visit.Save yourself the time and money and go to a REAL salon and avoid this SMOKE AND MIRROR act.

Perhaps the last honest gentleman's haircut in the OC, like a previous Yelper has stated.

I waited about two weeks and when I went there it was completely empty.. Their claim that they are booked for months seem to be a scam to make it look like everyone wants to go there... Unless they spend two hours or more per person which seems inefficient for all other customers who are waiting...I went there because of the good rating but I found myself disappointed. One side of my head was longer than the other and it just made my hair uncontrollable and messy. I couldn't wait to get another haircut from somewhere else. They decorated the tiny room a little bit and raised the price. While u can get a haircut from somewhere else for half the price from a less skilled hairstylist.. What's funny is that the outcome elsewhere turns out to be better. Is like 35+tip=40 for a haircut that I hated. One side of my hair always stick out and made me look like a newborn chick.

9/30/2015,0.22156666666666663,Positive,"Danckuts is the TRUTH when it comes to men's haircuts. In a time where ""barbers"" line out shopping centers, Danckuts finds itself snuggled in the backside of a quaint little plaza. Most barbers that I've been to all give the generic cut that makes you look like every other guy on the street as quick as possible to send you on your way and take the next transaction but at Danckuts, you're welcomed by the most friendly staff who take the time to know your name and what you do. Matt greeted me the first time I went and, although I didn't have an appointment at an appointment only establishment, he tried to accommodate me the best way he could, offering me a refreshing beverage, suggesting I wait while playing some Mario kart, and frantically going through the system to see if there was any way to fit me in their busy schedule. Luckily for me, there was an opening and I was greeting by Hailey(sorry if I spelled it wrong). Now I know what you're thinking, ""a girl at a barber shop?!"" I was thinking the same thing but thank God I threw away that mindset. The barbers that are there are some of the best barbers/chill people that I have met. With Zac's (the owner) system, you're going to get the perfect cut every time, customized just for you. I thought it was just a hoax at first but then after I got my cut, they took pictures of different angles of my head to save it in their system so that the next time I go, it'll be just how I want it.

No reduction in cost was offered. My time is too valuable for that bullshit. I can see 10 minutes late being acceptable. My workplace allows 10 minutes. After that it is unacceptable. Now when I am paying $35 plus $10 tip so $45 for a goddamn appointment time I expect my time to be valued. I don't want to hear any bullshit excuses. They need to hire more stylists and expand the space so that it can function like a well oiled machine. I work in service business and I take accountability when I mess up(which rarely happens). I make sure all of my clients are happy or satisfied. While my haircut was decent and the girl who cut it is awesome from a personality perspective I cannot support a businessman who takes zero accountability for wasting my time. While he was contrite, there was nothing done to alleviate my anger from a financial perspective. I don't need or look for freebies but I always expect great service and get great service from higher end establishments in any industry. I asked for clean sharp lines in my cut and that did not happen as well. I also do not receive the same level of service as other haircut places in the same price point. There is so much competition in this industry so they need to make sure they fix this crap. Later bro.",0

6/30/2016,0.22877865961199298,Positive,"I found out about Danckuts through a friend who highly recommended this place so i decided to give it a shot. I had a very pleasant and amazing experience the first time i got my haircut here and i had the same exact experience today. Zac cut my hair today and it could not have been any better. All the previous barbers and hairstylists that I dealt with in the past had one major issue and it was consistency. Everytime I would get a haircut, they were always off and could not duplicate the same haircut that I would ask for every single time. That certainly will not be problem here. After they cut your hair, they take pictures of all 4 sides of your head to make sure that you get the same exact haircut next time. Zac, as well as all the other employees are very knowledgeable, and are more than happy to answer any questions that you may have. They also provide you with many tips on how to style, blow-dry, and maintain your hair at tip-top shape. I am very satisfied with the haircut that I recieved and definitely plan to return in the future. They also provide you free drinks (beers included) while you wait, which is also a big plus!",0

9/18/2013,0.14413651824366108,Positive,"Believe the hype! I came two weeks ago and let me tell you, Zac was great. But let me start off by talking about Augustin, his assistant. Trying to call in and get a same day appointment, I was greeted with a voicemail prompting me to text for faster service. Texting into the number, I was greeted by Augustin and unfortunately told that they were booked for the day and through 2013. I was surprised.. how can you be booked until the end of the year?! I was texted back a couple of hours later saying that they had a spot open on Sunday, and I quickly accepted. I originally tried to get an appointment to get cleaned up for a bachelor party in Vegas, but seeing as how the only opening was when I came back, I agreed to see what the hype was all about.Currently, they're renting a chair with a neighboring salon, but hope to be in their new place soon. Walking in, I was greeted by Zac and when it was time to sit in the chair, you could sense his passion for this ""art"". He asked me several questions to get a feel of my style and how short I wanted to go and what I ideally wanted to do with it. The end result was perfect. It 's clean, neat, and tight. I've been going to a salon for a couple of years and they've become friends over the years, but I wanted to try something new and different and I'm glad I did. During the cut, Zac explained why they've been so busy, which is due to his passion for cutting hair and thereby gaining loyal customers. Where else can you find a barber in Irvine? I paid $35 for the cut which I'm used to, but to some it may be steep. I also didn't mind because they were able to squeeze me in and for the convenience, it's in Irvine and it's close to work. I'm sold.. book me up until the end of the year too! Just kidding, it's actually still hard to book appointments so Augustin and I are trying to work it out over texts.",0
5/28/2014,0.34227443609022556,Positive,"There's a reason why this is ranked a 5 star shop! Everyone really makes you feel comfortable & in a relaxed chill environment. The hair cut is Professional & Artistic. Zac is a grand master & Lorin has proven a true artist in her own right. Sorry for the dorky analogy, lol... I've been a consistently happy customer each & every time! & I will continue to be a customer for a long time. The only surprising thing, is I see a very young clientele, which is great. However, For the expertise & professionalism I see, I'd expect  older business men to go as well. There's no other men's salon that's better in Irvine!",0
8/26/2015,-0.02291666666666667,Negative,Let me just say I've searched long and hard for a barber I can rely on. About a year ago I got my first danckut by zac. I've been coming back every 2 weeks on Wednesday's @ 730. Never missed one appointment.  It's not just a haircut.  It's a lifestyle.  Danckuts till the day I die.,1

11/4/2015,0.11000000000000001,Positive,"I recently moved to Orange County and being away from my barber made me anxious.... I told myself I wouldn't get a haircut until I went back home. Time passed and my hair was just at an awkward length, I couldn't stand it. I was googling barbershops near me and stumbled upon this one. I read their mission statement, which was very technological and had full faith in what they were doing. I said hell with it and gave it a shot. I showed up, told them my name, and then they handed me a sheet with a multitude of different haircuts. Many of which I saw on Google images, and we're actually the same ones I wanted. I picked the one I wanted and my barber, Jordan, got straight to work. I tried a hairstyle my old barber was never able to do for me. After I saw the final cut I was amazed. I've never had a haircut like this in my life! And the best part is they take pictures of your haircut and save it in theirs system so next time you come you can get the same cut! Anyone who is looking for a QUALITY haircut go here ASAP! And also get a shirt, they're cool:)",0

Came across Zac on Yelp and with all of his reviews being 5 stars (this was before Bryan R. ruined his perfect score), I thought what the hell. Gave them a call, his assistant told me it was a 8 week wait.. and he wasn't kidding. I was in a situation and needed a good cut and after explaining to his assistant, Zac worked something out for me. I think he may even stayed pass closing time which shows his reputation proceeds as him as a genuine & hardworking guy who is willing to give a little extra for his guests.Zac knows what he's doing and takes his time. Super low-key barber joint with good vibes. If he is able to recruit more barbers just like him, I won't be surprised when down the road Cratchit Danckut is in every major city.",0

7/2/2014,0.30833333333333335,Positive,"I just had my hair cut there earlier today after raving reviews from some friends and Yelp reviews. Lauren did a great job on my hair, which is getting a little thin on top, she had some great suggestions, and taught my how to recreate her styling on my own. Not only are they proficient men's hair stylists, but it's an awesome little joint. ""More speakeasy than barber shop"" my friend said, with a choice of beer and liquor while you get your hair cut.Yes, it costs more than going to Fantastic Sams, etc, but the service is unmatched and well worth it.I'll definitely be back.",0
1/30/2014,0.17139674051438755,Positive,"It doesn't get any better than Zac. Plain and simple. Came into the place not knowing exactly what I wanted. Told Zac a vague description of what I wanted and he went to work. He read me to a T and cut my hair accordingly! I left the place very satisfied to say the least. The guy is super chill whom you can talk to for hours on end. He keeps you engaged throughout your haircut which helps a ton. If you are in the same boat I was in, and dont know what to do with your hair but want a new style, he's the guy to go to. Agustin, who works the desk and books everything, was super cool as well. They offered me a a beverage when I walked in which was already an indicator that the place is different than most. Point is, Cratchit Danckut's is the best place to get your hair cut bar none. Zac's definitely got my business going forward!",0

Only downfall is got to book your appointment awhile in advance but there's a reason for that, they give quality cuts!",0

Booking an appointment was easy; I was able to reserve a slot just by sending a couple of text messages. My appointment was yesterday, and I am overjoyed with the results. They even have a way to keep track of the exact haircut you got last time so that you don't have to remember anything between appointments.

They do great work but that usually translates to a wait time(which was the case for me). I just went in there a week ago and they've hired a new set of hands. They now have Zac, Lorin & Hailee. Hailee took care of me this time around. She consulted me on what I wanted to do and I told her, ""same as last time!"" Best part is, thanks to their system, she was able to give me the exact same cut that Zac did from my previous visit. No difference at all! The ability to get the same cut each and every time I come here no matter who takes care of me is what keeps me coming back(along with everything else).

I called and told them what kind of haircut I normally get (hard part comb over) and they said that that's exactly what the specialize in so I decided to give it a shot! Zac the owner is extremely talented and so is his staff. Lauren cut my hair and she's new but is being coached and trained by Zac and the work shows. I will be coming back no doubt because of the atmosphere and great work they do! Zac examines your haircut at the end to ensure that it is up to Zac's standards and that way your hair stays consistent with the company standards!
