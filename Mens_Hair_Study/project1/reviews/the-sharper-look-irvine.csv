I wouldn't want to meet that person. I am sure that they would not be pleasant to be around. I bet they're the same person that returns a drink at starbucks because the barista spelt their name wrong. You get the idea. Alisa does amazing work.I used to go to barbershops in LA that were $20/haircut and $15 with that ""i'm broke"" student id. The Sharper Look is well worth however much it is. She has an eye for detail. To make it easy, bring in a picture of what you want, Alisa won't disappoint.",0
2/25/2017,0.23259259259259257,Positive,"Pros: Quality haircut, good conversation, online bookingCons: None that I can think ofI needed a haircut so I decided to check out the Sharper Look. Luckily it's just down the street from my house. The Sharper Look is located in Sola Salons. Look for unit 21.I usually get a side part with a mid skin fade and Alisa did a great job on my haircut. She was very professional and was easy to talk to. I ended up opting for the VIP haircut so I got a nice towel wrap on my face at the end. Overall, a very relaxing experience.If you're looking for a quality men's cut, definitely check this place out.",0

9/5/2017,0.32814814814814813,Positive,"I don't trust anyone else besides Alisa with my hair. I have experienced my fair share of bad military barber haircuts so it is always a relief when I get a chance to sit down in Alisa's chair. She is always super sweet and makes you feel welcome. Her haircuts have got me numerous compliments in the year that I've been going to her, as well as compliments on my eyebrows, thanks to her brow waxing. She's great, listens to what you're trying to achieve with your hair and she is very good at what she does.",0

(As a GF, I'm happy to see he finally has a great haircut!)She was attentive, meticulous, and professional. She's as sweet as she looks!! He's seen her twice and both times have been a great experience. Would recommend getting the VIP men's hair cut service.

I really look forward to my appointments at the Sharper Look. When you walk in she puts on your favorite music and you are pampered until you leave.

6/11/2017,0.4847619047619048,Positive,"Alisa is great! She listens to you, makes suggestions, and works with you to give you the haircut that you want. I have very straight hair, which makes the imperfections stick out after haircuts, but Alisa did a great job, and her attention to detail and skill put me at ease. As a bonus, she's also really pleasant to talk to, plays music that you want to hear, and offers you drinks and tasty treats. Definitely check out The Sharper Look if you want a fantastic haircut experience!",0
11/24/2015,0.21004802489177488,Positive,"THEE BEST! I have recently moved from Bakersfield CA, to Newport and I was in desperate need of someone to give my brows a new look. Alisa over the past couple months has changed the shape of my brows and it they compliment my face much better than before.I have had trouble finding the right person to shape my brows, they were not the right shape before I started seeing Alisa, and now they look completely different! Especially now, we all know the importance of eyebrows and how hard it is to find the right person...trust me, I know! So thankful I found Alisa. Also, besides being a talented esthetician, Alisa is completely sweet and so understanding with booking appointments and getting you in with your time schedule! She is a perfectionist and takes her time with her work. I never leave YELP reviews, so trust me when I say she is the best.",0

4/9/2016,0.49250000000000005,Positive,I'm a 100% satisfied customer! I'm soooo happy with how Alisa shaped my brows. I really like the way she followed my natural arch and made it look much much better. I wouldn't be able to do that myself. I also got the brow tinting and she walked me through each step of the process which I appreciated... And the best part is I can wake up and skip filling in my brows which I know will save me a ton of time!!! Thx Alisa!! You're the best!! Will be back soon.,0
1/22/2017,0.10321428571428572,Positive,"Alisa came highly recommended by several friends and after my first appointment with her, I can definitelty see why!  Her styling and service was definitely on point and her welcoming personality and home baked treats were the icing on the cake!   If you are looking for a reliable, patient, and consistent hairstylist, look no further.  I will definitely be back!",0
4/9/2016,0.3517857142857143,Positive,Got my eyebrows tinted for the very first time and the result was great!

12/20/2016,0.28537037037037044,Positive,Repeat client and I highly recommend The Sharper Look to any man seeking a top notch look with excellent service. Alisa is extremely knowledgable and detailed in her craft. Her level of customer service is unmatched and she is super savvy on modern trends. I recently tried her Ali Natural Essentials formula and it makes the world of a difference to give you added radiance and glow.,0
11/27/2016,0.3481481481481482,Positive,I have been homeless regarding a salon to go to for half a year now and found Alisa on yelp based on all the wonderful comments people made about her skills.   She has a really cute mini salon within Sola in Irvine and was punctual with my appointment.   I brought my kids there and there was plenty of room for us  4 (including Alisa).   She spent a lot of time going over my facial shape and head shape and we together came up with a style that was appropriate for me and my face.    She used extremely good products on my hair.   Her skills were unquestionably good and you can tell she has cut a lot of men's hairs.    I will definitely be returning and now I am no longer homeless.,0
8/6/2015,0.40208333333333335,Positive,"Alisa hooked up my 14 yr old son , great fast service and did not seemed rushed , my son just looked more confident leaving after his cut.. Thanks Alisa!!",0
8/24/2016,0.16583333333333336,Positive,"In 2010 I had the honor of being the waiter for a beautiful lady and her mother. We chatted for quite a bit and her mother told her daughter to give me a business card  as she was an amazing hair stylist. At that time I had been going through some bad haircuts since my previous barber had moved away. Before I ever had a chance to try and get a haircut, I moved to San Diego for school. After that I became a wandering customer. 2 years in SD, 1 year in OC, 1 year in Shanghai, and now back in OC. I was wandering again until a couple weeks ago. I managed to run into Alisa at a wedding again after 6 years and was able to finally try her services. Thanks to Alisa & her mother, I've never looked more sharp.",0
5/31/2016,0.19484848484848485,Positive,"Always look forward to scheduling my cut with Alisa. She makes me look like I actually care to have some style rather than the black t-shirt n shorts kind of guy.  Her new location is very nice and much more quaint. You will feel much less awkward talking about funny (maybe inappropriate with children next to you) conversations. Just make sure to not schedule your appointment after 5:30pm on weekdays and 1:00pm on weekends, so I can get my haircut, OK? Those times are reserved for me. Thanks.",0
8/23/2016,0.3458333333333333,Positive,"Holy cow!  I've been pampered!  This is my first time to The Sharper Look and I must say that I am blown away!Not only is the haircut good, but the service was phenomenal!  Much attention to detail was paid, I was never in pain at any stage, and a nice warm wash at the end of the haircut completed the ritual!I must recommend place to everybody regardless of your gender and age. I think every salon should provide service like The Sharper Look.",0
12/30/2016,0.14625,Positive,Outstanding services talent and customer service. Alisa is professional friendly and creates a relaxing environment to reset and recharge. I'm not a big spa goer but I always look forward to my head-shave or buzz-cut because I leave feeling refreshed and revitalized. All products used are of high quality and scheduling is a breeze. I highly recommend that you give The Sharper Look a try the next time you need a haircut or other services.,0
8/12/2016,0.1798611111111111,Positive,Let me start out by saying I'm usually really picky when it comes to haircuts and  I've gone to around 15 different barbers / hair stylists in the past year now and still haven't found my go to spot until today. Alisa is great at scheduling so you usually won't wait more than 5 minutes and she can REALLY cut hair. I showed her a couple pictures of hair styles that I was looking for and she got me exactly what I wanted. She's super friendly and personable so don't worry about making small talk. I would really recommend this place to anyone living in the Irvine / Newport area!,0
5/20/2015,0.25880681818181817,Positive,"Have you ever had your hair cut with ancient Samurai Swords and shaved with ninja stars!!? Well, it won't happen here (unless you get taken to the secret backroom), but you can get you hair cut by a very skillful and attentionate hairdresser by the name of Alisa. She never rushes the job, takes pride in delivering quality work. She makes sure you feel comfortable and are part of the decision making process the whole time. I am very happy with my last cut and am definitely a newly hooked client!",0
4/30/2016,0.4179563492063492,Positive,"The best. Listens, takes her time and has a great eye for what would look best. Rumor has it, she left an earlier job because the manager thought she took too much time! Attention to detail, super friendly- any guy looking for a non cookie cutter supercuts special needs to get here. And, affordable- you'd pay twice as much for this much care at most places",0
3/11/2016,0.2725774225774226,Positive,"I am a guy that has been going to supercuts type places for years. My wife ""encouraged"" me to try something more upscale. I started going to Roosters in Irvine  a few years back. The first girl was nothing special,  but the second time I got Alisa. WOW. Not only did I look great when I left, the cut lasted 6 weeks. I get up ,shower ,comb my hair, thats it, and it looks great all day. Others have noted she  has  opened a new shop , see her for an appointment and a great haircut.",0
2/12/2017,0.35333333333333333,Positive,"After finding Alisa through Yelp and getting my hair cut and styled, I can confidently say that her unanimous 5-star rating is no fluke. I'm used to getting very cheap cuts, so I was a bit nervous going into the appointment, but she gives great recommendations and welcomes your input throughout the experience. A few more positives: online booking system, relaxed conversation, and homemade treats. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area!",0
4/3/2016,0.4494107744107744,Positive,"Alisa is an excellent hair stylist. I was lucky to get to know her when I first moved to this area about a year ago, and I keep coming back to her: her style is great and she is very consistent. The atmosphere at the new Sola location is nice and she makes you feel like you are in for a spa retreat; warm towels for the face, neck shave, etc.",0
3/2/2016,0.4166666666666667,Positive,Alisa is one heck of a barber.  She cuts my hair exactly how i want it and her attention to detail is second to none.  Haircut: ExcellentCustomer Service: ExcellentAvailability: Excellent.,0
2/27/2016,0.12627498388136688,Positive,"Alisa has been cutting my hair for a few months now and she is by far the most consistent and passionate barber I've gone to for quite some time. I always look forward to my haircuts since its always a pleasant experience and I always leave feeling way more relaxed. I've also never had such great comments about my hair until I started going to her, even though I've been going to some other top rated haircutters/barbers in the area for years. She's great all around - fantastic conversationalist, meticulous with cutting hair, and more than apt at hairstyle recommendations. Make sure to check out Alisa's new salon location at Sola Salons - it's has a quiet, relaxing atmosphere with curated products she recommends for her clients and its located next to the CVS drivethru over by the 24 Hour Fitness. Since she joined this new location, you can now setup appointments via text - a godsend for people with demanding schedules. She also provides a few other services, such as eyebrows, so be sure to ask her what else she can do for you since I had no idea. I was wasting my time going somewhere else for eyebrow services and am really pleased now that I can get it all done in one place.I've also been to a few barbershops with a very strong... culture, where the atmosphere is a bit contrived and annoying to deal with when you've had a long day. Alisa's salon is by no means pretentious - it's just a nice place to get your hair cut. Combine that with the fact that she's well spoken, educated, and cultured, and you have a very unique combination of character traits that evokes a high-end, but not judgmental, vibe. She also randomly bakes in small batches and you never know when a visit to her will contain cookies, toffees or other goodies.If you're finding yourself in need of a new barber in the Irvine area, you definitely have to pay Alisa a visit. I've spent quite a few years trying places out and definitely feel like Alisa provides the best cuts (consistent and clean), ambiance and overall experience.",0
12/31/2016,0.27458333333333335,Positive,Alisa does a fantastic job!  It is obvious from the moment you arrive she takes great pride in making sure her customers are well taken care of.  She offers a great haircut at a very reasonable price.   Her salon is always clean and well decorated....she even offers snacks (including homemade treats) and drinks to complete the experience.   She even does a fantastic job cutting my 4 year old son's hair...which is not an easy job and requires tremendous patience from Alisa.  I highly recommend Alisa!,0
1/28/2016,0.3125,Positive,Alisa is a true professional. She always does an amazing job with my hair and never rushes. I highly recommend Alisa to everyone!,0
4/10/2016,0.5766666666666667,Positive,"I am so happy that I found Alisa!! To be honest, this is the best brow tint I've ever had! Alisa knows how to match the color with my hair and create the most natural looking shape and tint for me. Her pricing is very reasonable too.",0
7/7/2016,0.5118333333333334,Positive,"Alisa is incredibly knowledgeable a what she does. I have been going to her exclusively for over a year for my brows and lashes. She is the kindest person. Her hard work has paid off and she is now available in her own studio! I love how professional she is, I know I am in good hands with Alisa. I highly suggest anyone to visit her for any of their beauty or grooming needs. She is incredible and very experienced. I always look forward to seeing her.",0
6/16/2016,0.2594444444444444,Positive,The first time I got my eyebrows tinted I was extremely amazed. I had no idea there was such a service. I ended up having them done again by Alisa.

She listens to your request and will do exactly what you need done and do a great job too! Highly recommended.,0

6/1/2016,0.38333333333333336,Positive,"Receiving a great haircut is just one of the many reasons I visit Alisa.  I also look forward to collapsing in her studio with a beverage while enjoying good music and interesting conversation.  On top of that, she washes my hair with a hot towel on my face while I fight to stay awake.  My only complaint is that my haircut takes about one hour instead of three.",0
12/25/2015,0.16571428571428573,Positive,"I stumbled across this gem at lunch a few months ago. For someone like me who doesn't have much hair left on the scalp, every strand of hair counts! What I like about Alisa is that she is in no hurry - she takes time to make sure you are comfortable with your haircut which I very much appreciate. I've been a regular since then.",0
11/29/2014,0.33916666666666667,Positive,"As someone who is very anal and picky about my hair and typically hates haircuts, I fully trust Alisa with cutting my hair.

She is able to accommodate any style that I ask for, and knows what looks good. Definitely very talented!",0
5/31/2016,0.24444444444444446,Positive,"Alisa is a wonderful stylist. As a previous review reported, she is still in business and this should not be labeled as closed.",0
4/26/2016,0.3112745098039215,Positive,"Just had another great haircut by Alisa and as usual, no complaints and I think it looks great. Alisa has been my working on my hair cuts for a better part of a year now and she always does a fantastic job. She's always open to suggestion, keeping it the same, or providing her input (which typically is the recommended way). I enjoy her conversation which is probably atypical for myself and the people who normally work on my hair, but she's pretty easy to talk to and it's welcomed. I'd recommend her to anyone who is or isn't happy with their hair stylist and would say I'd be surprised if you didn't like like her service and character. Thanks Alisa for all the good work!",0
4/11/2016,0.54,Positive,The best my brows have ever been! I've always gone to places nearby me but I'm so glad that I made the drive out.

She takes the time to a make sure everything is even making sure no brow hairs are out of place unlike some places where they try to get through it fast. I would highly recommend her.,0
4/7/2016,0.4636088154269972,Positive,"I only get my brows done by Alisa. She does a great job of shaping my brows while keeping their natural appearance, and is always pleasant and kind.

3/22/2016,0.40857142857142864,Positive,"Alisa is by far the best hair stylist I have found in Orange County.
