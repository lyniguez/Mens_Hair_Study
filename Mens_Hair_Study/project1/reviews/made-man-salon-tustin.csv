9/9/2017,0.328021978021978,Positive,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-GThis place is simply amazing, Yelena is incredible talented, passionate about her business and an incredible human being. I discovered Yelena last year and since then I don't let anybody to cut my hair. She gives an ultimate upscale 5 stars attention to her clients from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. She's simple a ROCK STAR!!!!!!!!!!! she's smart and her skills are out of this world. I always say: Once Yelena, you can't leave her. If I could give her more than 5 stars I would totally do it. She deserves more than that.",0
3/3/2017,0.45061688311688314,Positive,"I've been in Orange County for 7 years now and I've never gotten better service from anyone in the whole county.The first time Yelena saw me, she asked me about how I wanted to present myself to the people who are going to care about how I look (by way of conversation).  When I came out of there, I got compliments from everyone at work, at home, from my family, etc.The best part about it is that I never had to tell her how I wanted things.  She suggests what she knows will look good and I just say yes or no.  I knew right away she is a master craftswoman.I've been going to Yelena ever since and I refuse to see anyone else.  I'm so happy she struck out on her own.  Her new place is swanky!",0

I have been going to her for several years now and have always received great haircuts from her.She is the 'hair whisperer' as her knowledge of all things hair is truly incredible. She also helps with hair loss issues, color, etc.And, the ear and nose waxing is a must.Yelena sets the standard that all stylists should aim for. She gets a 10+ from me.",0
4/10/2017,0.37023809523809526,Positive,"Like many others I discovered Yelena at her previous salon years ago.  It's a testament to her skill and personality that virtually all of her appointments were from regular customers and not walk-ins.  She has passion for what she does and it comes through in the personal attention she gives her clients.  I am so happy for her that she made the leap of faith to open her own space, and did such a great job of making it a well decorated and comfortable place.  I love the way my hair looks when she works her magic, she knows exactly how to make it look it's best. I wouldn't go anywhere else.",0

2/12/2017,0.29095238095238096,Positive,"Yelena doesn't just cut hair, she treats everyone's hair like a piece of art. She takes her time asking your preferences while listening very carefully, and then follows through with surgical precision. She uses the best equipment and highest end products. Her barber chair is hand made with the finest leather and stitching, not your typical basic vinyl chair that you can't wait to get out of. You will sink into comfort and luxury while enjoying the best half hour of your day. Go treat yourself, you will see the  difference immediately.",0

2/28/2017,0.39870535714285715,Positive,I've been going to Yelena since I first moved to California 4 years ago and couldn't fathom having another stylist cut my hair again. Yelena's not only a master of her craft but she has the personality to match. The world would be a better place if there were more people like her in it! She recently opened up her own salon in Tustin (which is totally unique and comfortable) and I highly suggest you give her a shot she's 100% worth it. She has me feeling like I'm hot stuff everytime I walk out her door!! Lifetime customer for sure... Congratulations Yelena!! You are the absolute best!,0

I followed her from her previous salon to her new suite and all I can say is... WOW! It's elegant but comfortable, clean but with character, classy without being aloof. She truly cares about her clients and works tirelessly to make sure you have a fantastic experience each and every time. I've changed by hairstyle several times while seeing Yelena and she does a fantastic job (that earns me compliments!) every time! I couldn't recommend her more highly!",0
