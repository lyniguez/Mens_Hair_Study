It was a great experience, I knew instantly that Xuan was an experienced barber, she even cleaned up my beard and shaved the back of my neck line with a special trimmer. I came out refreshed and looking clean! 5 Stars! Will be back!!",0
8/24/2017,0.1408333333333333,Positive,"If there was a Zero rating, I would've given this place a zero. The older lady that works there first:she doesn't speak English. So I thought maybe if I show her a picture she might get it. I kept telling her TRIM, but somehow got translated into her own language to SHAVE. Then out of nowhere another hair dresser who was already with a client came to tell me that my son has a wavy hair!! Mind your own business lady. Customer service is the worst.",0
6/23/2017,0.01595238095238095,Positive,"I got Chi Tiffany as my barber today. She was a splendid barber. The moment I walked in, she was the first to greet me. She immediately asked me what I wanted after inviting me to her seat. I love that she greeted others while servicing me as well. It's a part of Vietnamese culture to greet guests when they walk into your home, so I definitely felt at home in here. The whole time she conversed with me while cutting my hair. I also love that. Of course, I was fluent in Vietnamese so it was a bit easier for her to talk in her native tongue to me. But from what I got, it seems like she is fluent in English as well. It's always a nice experience to have a conversation with the person cutting your hair in your personal space--that way it's not so awkward the entire time. I work at a swim school right behind this place, and it turns out that Chi Tiffany is the barber for a few of my managers as well! I'm surprised I haven't tried this place out sooner after working at the swim school behind it for five years! I'm definitely coming back to get my dose of haircuts and conversations with Tiffany!",0
6/9/2017,0.2672619047619048,Positive,"BEST HAIRDRESSER!!!  So glad Xuan is back in action in Irvine!  Sports Clips lost a talented stylist and Sand Canyon Barber gained one.Best part is you can make an appointment with her no more long waits and attitudes from the other stylist and management all because you wanted a perfect cut from Xuan. Nice environment, clean salon. Quiet and relaxing no more chaos. Call ahead to get an appointment with Xuan. If you walk in you have to request her directly!",0
6/11/2017,0.45,Positive,I used to go to SportClips in Woodbury but have now followed Xuan to this location. She is great at what she does and takes her time with clients. I'm glad to be able to make my appointment now via text rather than waiting in line. Ask for Xuan next time you go in.,0
3/25/2017,-0.1285714285714286,Negative,"How about you have your customers Face the mirror so they can comment on the progress of the hair cut? Instead they all have customers face the Opposite of the mirror so customers cannot even see how they are cutting the hair. They only show you the complete hair cut After everything is done. By then it is too late. One of the lady that work there said, ""this is not a salon."" Ohh, then why have all the mirrors up at each chair only to have the customer look at an empty wall when we could be looking at the progress of the haircut and critic it.",1
6/16/2017,0.3844444444444445,Positive,"This is a nice comfortable place to get a quality cut, way better than all those other chain stores that are no better than a used car lot.  Hands down Xuan is the best of the best, I can't say enough good things about the work she does.Do yourself a favor and make an appointment with Xuan, you will never regret it.  You can see for yourself all her devoted followers!",0
8/26/2017,-0.15000000000000002,Negative,"CAUTION: do not get a hair cut by the skinny, tiny, lady, (sometimes she wears glasses)!I came in yesterday for a haircut and asked for a low fade and spent an hour in her chair she didn't achieve anything close to a fade. A mate of her overheard my complaint about her haircut that she gave me and tried to fix the problem. Her mate did what she could be I thank her for that, but this lady nearly cut my entire hair off. I was supposed to have a comb over with my long hair up too and low fade to the side and now it looks like a toupee. The lady never once said sorry. At all!!!!",1

Not even a minimum of styleThere is more, before finishing my haircut and without asking for it, they put me a nasty and sticky blue gel on my hair. So I couldn't ask for fix some uneven parts and I had to go to another barber to fix the mess made. How can people like this make business? Unbelievable...",1

9/19/2017,-0.06428571428571428,Negative,"Went here a few times, disappointed today. First lady on the right cut my hair. She rushed and felt like she wanted to get it over with to move on to next customer hence more money. Towards the end she was a bit rude, I almost shouldn't have tip her but I did. At least she was thankful about that.",1
6/18/2017,0.5226666666666667,Positive,Great atmosphere and very clean.  The best part is you can make appointments.  Xuan is the best stylist ever! I followed her from Sports Clips and glad she was able to stay in Irvine. Xuan was the only reason I kept going to Sports Clips for so long.  Xuan is a master at her craft and has a great eye for detail.  Prices are reasonable as well.,0
6/15/2017,0.3229166666666667,Positive,"Recently switched over to Sand Canyon Barber since my stylist, Xuan moved to this location from Sports Clips.  Xuan always provides awesome haircuts with precision, and I can make very convenient appointments via text. Sports Clips may have some bells and whistles like showing sports on tv and massage chairs, but frankly all of it doesn't mean anything if I don't get great haircut and that's why I switched over when Xuan made the move to Sand Canyon Barber.  I can always rely on Xuan to provide exactly what I want and she shows the utmost care in what she does.",0
6/13/2017,0.6583333333333333,Positive,"Xuan is an excellent hairdresser!  I've been going to her for about two years now and she cares a lot about her clients, and is very detail oriented! Never rushes and takes her time! Very consistent and I always leave very pleased! Recommend her if you are looking for the best haircut in town! :)",0
6/22/2017,1.0,Positive,I switched to Sand Canyon Barber as I have been a client of Xuan for over 5years.  I like the location and the shop is well kept !   Xuan always does a great job for me and my son.    I'll be referring SCB to anyone I can !,0
7/8/2017,0.2234920634920635,Positive,"I followed Xuan over from a previous location, have been a client for years, and she still gives the best haircut around this area. Very precise, which is important for those of us with tough asian hair, and she cares about the quality of her work. Highly recommended for mens haircuts!",0
6/15/2017,0.1840017825311943,Positive,Sand Canyon Barber just stepped up their game by acquiring Xuan. Xuan has been cutting my hair for over 5 years now. I'm glad she found a new place that makes her happy. I recently moved to Yorba Linda and tried a few different barbers. No one can compare to her. What sets her apart is that she really knows her craft.  Her fades are always on point and my comb over still looks good after 6 WEEKS!!! She is a true artist. Sand Canyon Barber is nice and clean. Other stylists are frienldy. Make sure you call ahead to schedule an appointment if it is your first time. I usually schedule my appointment through text the night before.,0
10/7/2016,0.36241666666666666,Positive,"Me and my brother have been coming here for years. Before then I was bouncing around from barber to barber always leaving disappointed/mad from horrible cuts. Finally stumbled onto this place, the 3 stars doesn't do this place justice. This place is very clean with quality barbers. Everyone's very friendly here. The owner Tiffany is great with attention to detail, had no problem with adjusting the cut based on my requests. Neo is also very good too but all around a solid crew. I've had a cut from the majority of the barbers here and they're all good, you just gotta explain to them exactly what you want. Keep up the great work!",0
6/5/2017,0.3154269972451791,Positive,"I finally found where Xuan (sounds like swan) moved after she left Sport Clips in Woodbury. New place, but same great hair cut.  So glad she was able to fit me in for a trim given that I had a big meeting I needed to look good for.  She's now taking appointments so no longer need to wait forever at Sport Clips.Quick easy in and out and on my way.Ask for Xuan if you show up there.",0
6/16/2017,0.665,Positive,"Great haircut at this shop! Xuan is the best. She really takes her time on each cut, like every client truly matters to her. And her fades are flawless! It looks like my husband's hair grows like this naturally!",0
9/19/2016,0.35,Positive,Where did you go Cheryl?? Please message me on here if you see this. I had Tiffany cut my hair after Cheryl dissapeared. She did a great job. It's a nice barber shop. Good rates. Bad parking.,0
6/22/2016,0.28541666666666665,Positive,"Cheryl was great, walked in after work and got a great haircut with less hair stuck on me than usual. Pricier than the great clips by UCI but worth if you're in the Irvine center area and busy.",0
11/21/2016,-0.10416666666666667,Negative,"Went in to get a quick buzz. The guy stank of stale cigarettes, and when I went to pay I was told I ""need to pay with cash next time."" And that they'll ""do it this time on my card."" Shady spot, just go to sports clips just up sand canyon. I think it's BS to demand I pay with cash.",1
6/24/2017,0.4,Positive,"I followed Xuan here and couldn't be happier.  She has more time to care for her clients and my current cut is bay far the best she has ever done.  It's a nice quiet experience as well.  Only need an upgrade to the shampoo area and this will be a five.  Thank you Xuan, you are the best!!!!",0
4/5/2016,0.465,Positive,I want to highly recommend Cheryl. My son and I have been seeing her for years. Cheryl has great customer service and experience in what it takes to do a professional haircut. If  a great haircut is what your searching for go see Cheryl.FIVE-  STARS!!Kathy & Dave,0
9/21/2016,1.0,Positive,Tiffany at Sand Canyon Barbers provides excellent customer service and is an excellent listener and communicator.,0
6/29/2017,0.3061666666666667,Positive,I love this place! Xuan I am glad you left Sports Clips and came here. This place is very quite and very clean. You can make appointments which is a huge plus for me being I travel alot. You dont feel rushed and your money is well spent and appreciated here. Xuan has been my stylist for 12yrs now and she is amazing. I highly recommend this place.,0
6/2/2017,0.25833333333333336,Positive,"im not sure why im seeing so many bad reviews on here. anyways, the people here are so nice and they try to make good conversation with you while you get your cut. they did a good job on my haircut",0
5/3/2017,0.275,Positive,I've been getting my haircut here for years with outstanding results.  Tiffany always listens to my requests and I have to honestly say I've never received a bad haircut from anyone at this location.  Keep up the good work.,0
9/22/2015,-0.1791666666666667,Negative,"Don't go to this place.  They have one really good barber (older Asian guy) but they have terrible customer service.   And they charge $1 extra  to pay with debit/credit for haircuts that already cost $19. I wanted to wait for my barber and was push off repeatedly to some lady.  They kept saying how slow he was, blah blah blah. Terrible experience. I left without getting a haircut.  Hopefully he moves and takes his customers. Avoid this ""barber shop""",1
6/7/2016,-0.031249999999999983,Negative,Been here a few different times but hair cuts are never consistent because I never saw the same barber twice (literally they were not there). The last time I went my hair was shaved on the sides while the back was long. I came in to get my hair trimmed shorter (sister's wedding was coming up). The lady who cut my hair took the trimmers and cut a line across the back of my head and I ended up looking like Kim Jung Un of North Korea. It was so bad I asked for her to fix it and she told me they were closing in 10 minutes and to come back tomorrow.I was so embarrassed that I wore a hat until the next day I went to another barber and showed them what happened. Everyone that worked at the barbershop I went to literally laughed at the work that was done on my hair from Sand Canyon Barber.,1
6/12/2015,-0.017410714285714224,Negative,Want to mess up your hair and pay money for that? This is the right place. Tiffany mistakenly shaved my sideburn and asked me to pay the whole amount when she was done even though she messed up my hair really bad! She thought I'm Iranian and said bad things about iranian and how cheap they are! (I'm not iranian) I will try to post a pic of my hair! Pay more for the place next door and save your hair!,1
6/24/2015,-0.09702380952380953,Negative,"STAY AWAY! There is a reason this place got so many negative reviews.After checking Yelp and seeing all of the bad reviews of this place, I was very hesitant. I went anyway because I was in a hurry and it is very close to my job. I am beyond disappointed. I should have listened to my fellow Yelpers. This is by far the worst haircut I have ever received. They can't even do a simple buzz cut right. There are uneven patches of hair all over my head. I was rushed in and out, and they did not listen to a word I said as I told them what I wanted on my head.Save your time and money, there are much better barbers in Irvine.",1
9/19/2017,-0.035030864197530875,Negative,I usually get my hair cuts from mike. He is the best but he wasn't there today and I really needed a haircut so i just waited for the first one who was ready and here comes this rude Asian lady. I wish I got her name down but she was an idiot. I always get a higher fade with a trim using scissors on top it's always a skin fade. She acted surprised when I said skin fade. And when she started shaving my head she finished in like 15 minutes. When I got home on one side of my head it had my hair then the other and then the idiot didn't even use scissors she use the machine to cut the top and she use the scissors once to cut the front but when she used it she was just cutting all around not even taking the time and cutting it even. And it's a 20 dollar hair cut but it's 22 if you use scissors and style it. And she made me pay 22 bucks. If you ever go to this place ask for mike. Or the guy next to him. Never cheat on your barber.,1
6/28/2016,0.40138888888888885,Positive,"Great for a quick haircut , The people here are always friendly and courteous .  Parking can be difficult if you go during Lunch time but otherwise Great place .",0
12/19/2015,-0.31527777777777777,Negative,Do not waste your time and money hereThere is nothing worst then a bad haircut.I told the guy 4 times not to cut it short and of course he did.How hard is it to give a regular men's haircut.,1
5/27/2016,0.32780303030303026,Positive,I was fortunate to have Tiffany who gave me a great looking haircut and for a good price. It's hard to find a barber in Irvine that can cut Asian hair. Luckily I found this place and it's real close to where I live. Definitely coming back.Edit: Still coming here after over a year! Mike and Tiffany still give great haircuts!,0
1/14/2016,0.22282196969696969,Positive,"I have been coming here since I moved to Orange County 5.5 years ago, and I often drive a little out of my way to come here.  It is a rather easy place to get your haircut.  I have had my hair cut by 4-5 of their barbers over the years, and for the most part, I've always been happy.  I think a lot of people come to Yelp to gripe, and it is rarer for them to come here and leave a positive review.  Of course, everyone has very particular opinions on how they want their hair to be, and I also know that my hair sometimes takes a week or two to grow out to the point where it is exactly the way I like it.  I will be moving soon further away from South Irvine, and I guess I may have to find a place a little closer to me, but I will return here anytime I am in the area!",0
6/10/2015,-0.12777777777777777,Negative,Barbers don't listen to what you request and somehow saying a quarter inch off the top means an inch and a half. Spent 45 minutes here and still walked out with an awful haircut. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who plans to be seen in public in the weeks following their trip here.,1
5/22/2015,-0.3474999999999999,Negative,Rude and bad service and haircut. This girl that called Tiffany is very rude and have no ethics when dealing with customer. Never going back to this barber shop again,1

I followed Cheryl from the now closed barber shop in University Park and even though the new location is a bit out of the way, the time spent is totally worth it.

2/8/2015,-0.28305555555555556,Negative,"This place doesn't even worth one star!I'm so frustrated with this barber shop; The owner is very rude, argumentative and has 'ZERO' Customer Service. Tiffany the owner as I learned from the other workers has no experience in cutting kids hair and has 'NO' clue of business ethics.  Tiffany was so mean when moving my sons head around while she was cutting his hair and she was also giving him an attitude and talking to him very rough. She did a terrible job on his hair and when I asked her to cut it shorter to fix it she had a total attitude telling me that my sons hair is wavy and there was nothing wrong with the hair cut. When I requested her partner to adjust my sons hair because she was busy, she refused and told me that I had to pay again or call the police if I don't like it. While she was adjusting his hair, she started talking loud with a total attitude...I asked her politely to stop talking and finish what she started.When she was done, I asked for her name and license number but she refused to give me the license number and thats when she became really RUDE with her tongue.Unfortunately this was not my first time at this !#^%?&@$ place and all the guys I usually cut my hair with where on vacation. This woman's attitude was miserable!",1

4/17/2016,0.13499999999999998,Positive,"been going here about 3 years now and been going only to Neal never had any problem but do not know anything about the other barbers but I could tell you Neal is really professional and has a really good customer service, but the lady manager is ehhh... so if you are gonna go here I recommend going only to Neal.",0
8/26/2011,0.2606423611111111,Positive,"There aren't cheap barber places here in Irvine, only Westminster, but this was my last resort. My first experience was pretty good. The barber was friendly as we were able to have a good conversation and deliver an excellent haircut very meticulously.The second time was completely different. This time a woman cut my hair. She was very impatient. My top wasn't evenly cut!!! I know I should have complained about it at that time, but I was in a rush and I just managed to change my hair-do. They should promote a student discount here, unless they're trying to teach kids how to cut their own hair. Heck it saves time, money, and a bad cut.PS- They charge you a dollar if you pay by card.",0

1/2/2015,0.039999999999999994,Positive,"They charge $1 if you use a credit card so in return I took off $1 off my tip. The cut was good, lots of fancy moves that did not do a thing. The haircut is overpriced on purpose to cover for customers not tipping. The added $1 for credit card purchases is the worst business plan ever. You end up with crappy reviews on Yelp. Customers always remember the last part of the experience and most likely they won't return.",0
7/3/2015,0.19318181818181818,Positive,Wait wasn't too long was probably the only upside. I asked for the barber to not cut the top of my hair but not only did he cut the top it was uneven. He said that was the style... He really didn't know what he was doing. Don't go to the guy that sits at the chair to the left closest to the window. Other than that prices are fair and the atmosphere is nice.,0
4/17/2013,0.0827272727272727,Positive,"I walked into this place 2 years ago and have been going here for about that long. Some cuts were pretty good, some were awful. For the most part service have been very impersonal, quality is inconsistent, prices are too high for what they do there, add a dollar if using a card. (i'm pretty sure thats actually illegal, but i didn't have a lawyer present)After going there for 2 years I have absolutely no qualms about ditching these guys and never going there again. I think the feeling is mutual.",0
11/25/2015,0.04928571428571429,Positive,"This place sucks! Wish I could give it ZERO stars. I came in with my son today. Tried calling ahead to make an appointment, but they don't take appointments- walkin only. Got there and there were 3 people waiting. (2 people working) I asked if I needed to sign in - I was told there was no need for that and we were 2nd in line. Just then 2 other barbers came in, as did 3 other customers. We waited and waited,while everyone was helped BUT us. After an hour of waiting, we walked up to the chair as the barber, Neal, finished up with a customer. Just then another customer walked up to the chair as well. I said I was next, but he got upset and wanted to be helped right away. The barber, Neal,  asked us if he could help him first, but I said no because we were there first and had been waiting about 30 min longer. Well that turned into a HUGE explosive temper tantrum by the other guy. Yelling and cussing in front of my kid. Meanwhile the barber said nothing and said he couldn't remember who was first and so on. After the man left he remembered that we were first. after 5 min, the man came back to keep yelling and cussing at me my AND my 5 year old son. The barber still said nothing to the irate customer. He actually tried again to get me to let the man go first. Customer service here sucks. I won't be back.",0
8/18/2011,0.23190476190476192,Positive,"Took my 16 month old to get his first professional haircut here on Wednesday afternoon. The salon is large, clean & decorated with old-fashioned barbershop stuff. They have a cool little play area for the little ones, which my son loved afterwards.Sonny was the one who cut his hair. I sat in the chair with a robe over me while my son sat on my lap with a robe over him. I showed Sonny a picture of what I wanted and he cut my son's hair in what felt like 15 minutes. My son cried the whole time, but he still got a good haircut. Sonny gave him a lollipop & kept giving me tissues to wipe my son's tears. I appreciated how quick he was.Children's haircut is $14, plus $1 if you pay with a credit card. This is a very good price since I researched some other places that specialize in child haircuts & it usually costs $20 or more. Will definitely take my son here again.",0

I sincerely tried to give this place a chance but I got the same crappy high fade that every dude in a asian street car club has.The stylists are nice enough, but they lack skill and only know one cut. Oh and did I mention that they use Automotive Air Compressors to brush the hair off of you? Yeah I went deaf in one ear for days after the girl blasted me DIRECTLY INTO MY EARDRUM!That was the last straw. This place should be about 10 bucks cheaper for what you get and they should have a few lawsuits against them for intentionally making their clients DEAF.",0
11/27/2014,0.25677083333333334,Positive,"First and foremost, this is not a barber shop.  This is important because some people actually like to go to barber shops.  I've gone to Sand Canyon Barber twice and have gotten my hair cut by two different guys.   I focus on three things when I go somewhere to get a haircut - cost, time and quality.   Cost - $20 for a simple men's haircut.  Not bad considering the area. Time - Fairly long.  Don't come here expecting a quick haircut.  I think the first time I came it took them almost an hour to trim my hair.  I think it takes a while because the stylists are really into their art.  They're focused and mostly quiet.   Quality - Great!  I've never had a stylist cut my hair and put product (Crew?) in it and THEN show me and ask how it looked.  But dangit, it looked good! I'd give them 5 stars and make this my regular spot if I could get in and out quicker on weekdays.  I think I'll keep looking around but I'm sure at some point I'll be back.",0

6/14/2015,0.4175,Positive,Very nice place and you get a good cut at a good price.  Been going there since they opened and its always been a  pretty consistent experience (much more so than competitors in the same price range - the turnover in those places is really high). Recommended.,0

The salon is large and they have a lot of staff. They move quickly, but have a great attention to detail. Minimal wait, clean, tidy surroundings, great haircut and a great price.",0

I just saw it after the haircut was over.We went in around early afternoon, there was no one there and the whole haircut was done super fast. It only cost $12 which is relatively cheap by Irvine standards. Would probably come back again if we needed a #2 buzz sometime in the near future.",0

I like their fair prices, too. If you want to use a cc they have to charge $1 extra to cover bank processing fees. I pay with cash to save everyone the hassle. Try them.",0

7/2/2009,0.27515873015873016,Positive,"Just OK. Not a typical barbershop - this place is more like a Hairmasters with a barbershop motif. Basic cut was $15 and the place is clean and the stylists were quick and friendly enough. The 'barber' that did my hair was confident and got right to work. She did a good job with clippers, but seemed less experienced with scissors. I am giving it a 3 out of 5 stars for an overall average rating.",0
