4/6/2018,0.24652777777777776,Positive,"Omar is the definition of quick, efficient, and detail-oriented. It is very refreshing to find this combination of talent. He is an absolute wizard with a set of scissors and clippers. Came on a Friday afternoon and even with a few people waiting ahead of me, I love how was in and out in about 30 minutes for a cut and wash. If there's no wait, I'm sure it would have been even faster. This is a welcome and stark contrast to other ""stylists"" and haircut places that can take an hour or longer. Few tips for a good experience:Send him a text to confirm when you want to come inKnow beforehand what type of hairstyle you wantCash only $20 + tip",0
2/28/2018,0.2738095238095238,Positive,"I rarely leave Yelp reviews. After seeing how Omar treats each of his clients is straight up genuine. You will leave feeling like you left your own house after a fresh cut and shower. Beginning to end, Omar was quick yet accurate when it came to the drop fade I asked and trimming the top. After, his assistants help you with a personal wash for your hair and the experience was just relaxing. I am coming back here in two weeks but Omar has an amazing passion in cutting hair + experienced.",0
2/5/2018,0.04083333333333333,Positive,"Thanks to Reddit, I learned of Omar about 2 hours ago. As of 20 minutes ago, I had my first cut from him - it definitely won't be my last. A pic of the general style I was after (Mad Men) was shown and he was off to work. All in, I was there for only maybe 8 minutes. He's freaky fast, yet detail-oriented. I never was a fan of the small talk associated with getting a haircut, but Omar is so focused that that's a non-factor. Before I knew it, he handed me off to his assistant to do a quick wash, blowdry, and style. Thanks again, Omar!",0
4/9/2018,0.24722222222222223,Positive,Omar is not only a great barber. He is super fast! In and out. Definitely a bonus for people with busy schedules,0
4/8/2018,0.45,Positive,Great guy and great cuts. Cash only though so be prepared to either use the nearby atm and pay  fee or have it ready on hand.,0

I went there and waited in line all and all maybe 10 min; he was quick and to the point, he gave me the exact hair cut I wanted. Definitely very happy I found him, I'll be going to him regularly from now on. Thanks Omar",0

Bad hair cut.I told him to cut a little bit form his hair, but he didn't listen and ruined his hair.It's not a true at all , first thing , I have an appointment already , I can approve you , your I messages .

3/9/2018,0.26539502164502166,Positive,"After taking many gambles and getting my haircut at major chain places, I decided to seek a new barber through yelp and that's where I found Omar. I have had my haircut by Omar twice and will be returning to him every month. He is consistent, quick and detailed. I feel satisfied after he cuts my hair and have complete confidence in him. Haircuts are $20 cash (make sure to leave a good tip), text appointment only and comes with a complimentary shampoo wash. I was in and out of his barber shop in less than 25 minutes, which is convenient for busy schedules.",0
7/27/2017,0.18461538461538457,Positive,"In a world where barbershops are dropping in quality consistency and prices are skyrocketing shamelessly, Omar the Barber comes to save the day.  Johnson S compared him to Picasso, and I laughed this off as a mere hyperbole.  What an ignorant idiot I was.  Omar the Barber truly is an artist.  I felt like Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands was working on my hair.  He is freaking FAST, whoosh whoosh whoosh and suddenly I had the slickest, fliest most dopest hair cut I've had in a while.  I've been to a lot of barbershops in the Irvine/Tustin/Santa Ana area, and Omar decimates the competition.As stated before, I was pleasantly surprised to find out the cut comes with a hair wash and styling at the end.  Absolutely worth the $20, and I gave him a good tip because I will be definitely be back and I hope to get the same royal treatment.  Thanks for the great service Omar!",0
1/22/2018,0.24107744107744106,Positive,"I never leave yelp reviews, mostly because I'm lazy but man, I had to write one for this place. Omar is an excellent barber, fast and professional, not rushed at all. Before each step, he asked me what length/style I wanted, so I ended up with the exact cut I was looking for. The complimentary wash and blow dry was the icing on the cake.Safe to say this is my new go-to spot for cuts. For $20, you can't beat it.",0
2/8/2018,0.1,Positive,Omar is one of the fastest barbers I've had! Reasonably priced haircut with a shampoo and wash. I had a barber for a while and stopped by on a whim one afternoon and have come back ever since.,0
1/1/2018,0.4266666666666667,Positive,"Personable, blazing fast, perfect cut every time. He is now my main barber.He doesn't talk very much, but is still somehow very personable. Focuses on the job at hand. The assistants have always been pleasant as well. I have no plans to switch.",0
1/17/2018,0.4444444444444445,Positive,"No joke the best haircut in OC. I've been to all the fancy hipster barbers, and none come even close to this man's skill and service. You even get a rinse and shampoo after the cut for less than the price of the rest. Love this guy.",0

10/13/2017,0.3375,Positive,"I have tried so many places for my hair cut through out the years regardless of cost, and finally I can say that I found the perfect guy (Omar), who does the best and most suitable cut I've ever had .Omar is very personable, professional, efficient and does exactly what you tell him to do .During the first hair cut, One will immediately notice the many years of experience and skills that he had when using the scissors, blades and such, not to forget the system utilized in every step he takes from cutting to touch up and washing without wasting a minute of anyone's time . I recommended him to my son and friends and he became their favorite hair stylist (barber) on their first visit. Keep it Omar ! You got us for life",0
6/10/2017,0.35294372294372295,Positive,"Great guy, great cut and price. I'll be back :)Omar takes cash only. Luckily. There's an ATM at the market right next door to the salon with a $3.00 transaction fee.The cost of the haircut is $20. Compare that to the men's haircut place in the same plaza Dankcuts for $35.He takes appointments thru yelp messages, and if very easy and nice to book appointments with.",0

1/27/2018,0.11724747474747473,Positive,"This was a new experience for me. I walked in and the lady said that Omar does not usually do walk ins so I began to leave and then he signaled for me and told me that he could take me after he finished with his current client! This was great! When I sat down I told him what I wanted and he did it really fast! This is a quick in and out place! He finished cutting then a lady took me to wash my hair, then he took me back and finished up and that was that. I think my total came out to be about 25$ with tip.",0
8/23/2017,0.16289062500000004,Positive,As expected he did an amazing job. Not to mention the guy took like 5 minutes for a perfect cut. I'm the kind of mom that hovers and tells people to make Corrections. Not one time did I open my mouth unless he asked me a question. I will admit he's not the type of person you would take a small child to. He's a professional barber. Does his work fast and efficiently with many different tools . Take your little one to a professional child hair cutter. My kid is only six but sits very still and it worked for us. Going to send my husband to him next! Never going to any other Barber again that's all I have to say!,0
5/2/2017,0.07435897435897436,Positive,"Look, I'm sure this guy is a chill dude and whatever, but stars should be based on service. 1 star for booking a couple hours before and responding to my texts quickly. But that's about it. I asked for a 2 fade. He didn't fade. I asked for a comb over cuz my hair was getting hella long with an undercut I've been doing for awhile. No comb over. He just cut the top shorter. Pulled hair up, cut straight through. Now my head is left with no fade, and no comb over. Instead I got my hair at an awkward ass length where it looks like its trying reaaaal hard for an undercut but its too damn short for that. Just sticking out on the side. Also, I was definitely in shock by how he just manhandled my head/hair while cutting. Felt like he was trying to break my neck every time he was moving me side to side. The other problem was that he did this all in 5 minutes. I get it if you got a line of customers who have been waiting for a while, but there was no one until like halfway through my cut. Halfway, meaning 2.5 minutes. And even then just a couple others. Wanted to just get a clean fade and combover. Shouldn't be much to ask for from someone with 4.5 star rating with 200+ reviews. $20 bucks was way too much for this. I would've been better off going to supercuts. Same crappy ass cut for 1/4 of the price. Now I gotta go find a different spot to get this fixed and dish out more money. Thanks for wasting my money. At least you didnt waste more than 5 minutes of my time so I can still find someone open on the same day.",0
5/17/2017,0.033333333333333326,Positive,"Not only does he not answer the phone, he's super curt over text.---After I posted my review online, he texted me a few hours later to harass me about the poor review.--He then followed up with a condescending message over Yelp. Super professional. Wow. This guy is nuts.",0
3/11/2018,0.23098655730234674,Positive,"Omar is top-notch. He is professional, clean, quick (cuts usually last around 10-15 minutes), and efficient. He also really cares about his clients. I ran into some heavy traffic on my way to him one day and he was very understanding of the situation and took me in no problem. He always checks with me to make sure I am satisfied with my cut and takes the time to make any (rarely happens as he gets it right the first time) corrections. I used to live in Irvine but now I'm in the inland empire. I tried other barbers but none have come close to the finesse of Omar. Any time I know I will be in the area and I need a cut, I hit up Omar. He always makes time for me even if it is the same day. If you are on the fence on trying him, let this serve as that ""bump"" you need to try him (among the other 4/5 star reviews). Seriously one of the best in the business.",0
1/4/2018,0.26476190476190475,Positive,"Moved to Irvine for school, worried I couldn't find a good barber until I came here. Professional cut and is fast. After a while Omar will know what you want. Been coming here every month and i am satisfied every single time. Highly reccomend",0

I highly recommend Omar and I will definitely be his regular customer!",0
2/17/2018,0.5066666666666667,Positive,Literally the best there is. He is a good soul inside out. My boys LOVE getting their cuts and sit through no problem. It helps that he's SUPER fast--but you don't lose quality. Can't recommend him enough-- my kids and husband get compliments on their cuts all the time.,0
2/5/2017,0.22653846153846155,Positive,"Love Omar. He's a great guy. Always friendly, always nice.He's very, very personable.Couple things:1. Cash Only2. Haircuts are $20 (includes a shampoo/styling if wanted).3. Omar is deaf. Nothing wrong with that at all, just allowing you to know as a consumer if you're looking to have an in depth convo. keep that in mind. He can read what you're saying and understand you.4. He has assistants. Omar is a busy guy. He always has people back to back, so keep that in mind. His assistants most of the time will be the one's washing your hair, blow drying and then styling if you have them.5. He has jokes. ;) 6. He keeps up on trends. He understands stuff like high fades, low fades, etc. Take a picture with you of what you want and he'll nail it.Thank you Omar, love you man.",0
8/30/2017,0.3757369614512472,Positive,"Texted Omar at 4 pm, set an appointment for 6pm the same day. I get there and he cuts my hair right away. FASTEST cut I've ever gotten and hands down honestly the best haircut I've ever gotten. He cut my hair in about 10 mins and they even washed my hair for me!! Best $20 I've ever spent on a haircut.",0
11/14/2017,0.09083333333333332,Positive,"Omar is a prime example of someone who just ""gets it."" No unnecessary fluff, no waste, no calls even! Just proper precision work. He's super fast yet never rushed. He keeps it simple yet he's very thorough. And above all: he respects the customer's time. As long as I'm in OC I'll be seeing him for my hair, and I have a lot of hair.",0
5/18/2017,0.13533549783549784,Positive,"My old shop got rid of the barbers I liked so it was time to find a new place. Also, I've been getting buzz cuts my whole life, so I wanted to switch it up a little. Went to see Omar for my appointment and I was seated and was getting my hair cut 15 minutes before my appointment time. Was a little skeptical about how a different hair style would look on me, but it came out amazing and I am super happy. I will definitely be coming back to Omar next time.",0
7/19/2017,0.06197916666666667,Positive,"I'm always a little wary of 5 star reviews but Omar has earned them. Texted him for an appointment. He responded within minutes with his next opening. My son was in and out in less than 10 minutes. If it's your first time, take a picture of what you want done because he's not much of a talker. I showed him the Beckham hair style and he nodded and then did his thing. Thanks for a great experience!",0
1/27/2018,0.48333333333333334,Positive,Fast and best cut you can ever get. He is my husband's barber  he is supper fast and a perfectionist !,0
10/27/2017,0.5083333333333333,Positive,Omar is the best barber in OC. I lived in Irvine for 2 years and Omar was the guy every time I needed a cut. I moved to Newport Beach for a year and made the 20-30 minute drive for my guy Omar. 20 minutes and you have a fresh cut and wash. Best times to go are weekdays just because he's so loved on the weekends. Don't look for another barber and waste your time. If it's your first time pictures of the cut you want helps.,0
10/27/2017,0.3258888888888889,Positive,"By far the quickest haircut Ive had in my life (5-6mins). I felt like at an assembly line of a busy factory. Initially, I didnt really like it because I felt like he was rushing to get me out of his way but from what I understand now, thats how Omar works. So I was going to rant about how poor/rushed the service was, but then I looked at the mirror and my haircut was on point! Much better than the ones that i've had before which took 30-45 mins. So I guess it is not the process but the result that matters the most and the results were great. Omar himself is a very nice, polite professional and he cuts as a lightning! So why change it if it works. Definitely coming back. Quick, good look and good price (20$ for mens cut - cash only).",0
5/5/2017,0.2919999999999999,Positive,"I have tried many barbers and finally I found the one who knows what I want , Mr Omar is fast and nice. I havegood experience with him and highly recommend him.The price is $ 20 including hair wash. And it will take 15 to 20 minutes  to finish your haircut. You can also walk in or text him.",0
1/28/2017,0.0875,Positive,"Nice guy, but I'm used to getting a hair cut and beard shape up for $25. This place charges $40 bucks. I never heard of anything so expensive.  Usually my cuts are $20 and an additional $5 for the beard, leaving room for a $5 tip. I recommend adjusting the price and you will see a lot more customers. Just my opinion.",0
9/13/2017,0.4,Positive,"Holy f### does Omar cut fast! I'm pretty sure he is trying to squeeze me into his schedule, but woah. Imagine someone cooking street food, but with your hair instead. It came out nice too. Tenn out tennnn.",0
1/6/2018,0.28357142857142853,Positive,"Yes, he is fast, but he is also accurate and precise. I gave him a picture of a hair cut style I was looking for and he made a cut very similar to what I was looking for. I'm glad I found my barber in OC! Highly recommended and reasonable prices.",0
9/29/2016,0.2760942760942761,Positive,"Let me start off by saying Omar has the ability to give a 5-star haircut every time. He's that good. I just think he's become bigger than his bandwidth. Every time I visit my parents in Orange County (I lIve in LA), and need a cut, I know I can rely on Omar. With that said, dude just speeds thru your cut to basically get on to the next person in line. Like why did I schedule a haircut days in advance if you are literally going to spend 5 minutes on my hair? I'd honestly rather, for the price of the haircut ($20 - and it's CASH ONLY), go somewhere else that takes their time.Imagine if In-N-Out franchised. Do you think a double double with grilled onions and fries would be as good in all 50 states as it currently is in just CA, Nevada, and AZ?Again - Omar is really good at cutting hair. He has just become too popular and in-demand to spend the time on your cut. It seems his logic is why take 20 minutes to cut one person's hair when you can take 20 minutes and cut 4 people's hair. I get the logic, it's a business, and they are running it as efficiently from a business sense as they can. But I think it's effecting the loyal ones that have been going there for a while. I no longer will be spending my $20 for a 5-minute haircut. Although I do appreciate the many many good haircuts Omar has given me thus far.",0
9/13/2017,0.45625000000000004,Positive,"Omar was awesome. Barbers are rare to find these days, usually you can only find cosmetologists. Having him like me up with a straight razor was so nice. Awesome haircut, and a great guy all around.",0

Oh, Omar and his assistant appreciated that we brought a picture of wanted haircut.",0
9/5/2016,0.004166666666666682,Positive,"As much as I like Omar and how hard working he is, I have to say that I need to find another place to get a haircut. I did not like my haircut in my previous visit and decided to give another chance (you know, not everyone is perfect.He is very skillful, but he does not spend enough time cutting your hair. It is great that he has a lot of customers. However, he is always in a rush and tries to get done asap. I timed my haircut time today - 6 mins (!). It looks completely different from the picture I showed him. Also he texts making appointments during your haircut. I believe it would benefit if his assistant did that for him.Well, I have to find another place now...",0

9/5/2016,0.12971014492753624,Positive,"Omar is definitely one of the better barbers I've been to in recent years. His cuts are usually 20-30 mins long and thats a testament to his speed and precision. I say precision since he's precise and efficient with his tools. To book and appointment with him you send him a text and work out a time. Usually appointments are same day but you can book them way in advance. Once you arrive and are seated Omar works on your hair, usually 15-25 mins depending on how you want your cut. After hes finished one of the people at the salon does a quick hair wash with shampoo, drys your hair and gels if you'd like. He doesnt take card, however, i have seen hin let people drive to an atm and come back to pay. He charges 20 for everying. And thats a typical appointment with Omar. One thing i will say as an subjective con is that he doesnt talk much and is very focused on your cut. If you're the kind of guy who like talking with their barber he might not be a good fit for you however, some of the people at the salon where he is located are pretty talkative and are willing to talk to you once they clean you up. I've enoyed every haircut I've had over the past year, and im definitely coming back.",0

There is an ATM next door. But this was a bit inconvenient.He has amazing talent, my haircut was incredibly fast. Some people say too fast for the money, but I think that he just knows what he's doing. Skill equals efficiency, and efficiency means less time. Makes sense to me.$20 haircut and $20 beard (Incase someone was wondering)",0
9/15/2016,0.0787878787878788,Positive,Omar is an exceptional stylist and great human being.

4/28/2017,0.4706709956709957,Positive,I'm deaf too and i met this person name's omar. It's easy to communicate to him or described for what i need to cut my hair. I like this person. He was deaf friendly. I would recommend to anyone. I got my new hairs that i'm happy because i can picked it which i like the model. It's perfect for me. He was fast to cut too. It's kinda relax and cool.,0
5/28/2016,0.1642857142857143,Positive,"He's a solid dude and responded super fast to my text. Not a man of a lot of words and works really fast. I'd say for the amount of time he spent he did an amazing job, but unfortunately missed a few spots I had to clean up at home. He didn't take too much time figuring out what I wanted even though I tried to explain to him.If you're looking for a fast cut and you have a busy schedule I  would say this place is a 4/5.

I'm a pretty simple guy and have had my hair cut the same way my entire life.  I recently had a terrible haircut at this other place and I had a wedding to go to this weekend so I was freaking out a bit.  I looked up Omar and luckily he had some availability the same day. I showed him a picture of how I typically get my hair cut, and he was a bit shocked.  He was very considerate and kept telling me that my hair would be okay in 2 months but that he'll cut it shorter than i'm normally used to. I must admit, I was so impressed to see the fix he did with what he had to work with!  I think i've found my barber for the next 20 years!.",0

He could've told me to make an appointment and come back but instead he decided to cut my hair in 5 minutes so that he could help the person who actually had an appointment. I have no idea what part of that cut costed $20 as my hair was pretty crooked and there was no way to fix it but grow it back out. I'd say that hair cut felt like the $2.50 cuts you get from students.",0

No more bad haircuts from Supercuts! So I decided to make my boyfriend an appointment here. He kept going to Sport Clips and while it was super convenient because it was across the street, the haircuts were always mediocre and somewhat pricey. Omar changed all that! My boyfriend was pretty hesitant going at first but he was really glad he did. His haircuts are always amazing now! He gets a perfect fade and a clean cut every time. The best part is when his hair grows out it still looks good! Omar is super fast and efficient. You're in and out in twenty minutes! Twenty bucks and just text him to make an appointment!

I think one time it took him an hour and I started to worry he was sick or something. But even an hour is great.  I saw another review complaining about Omar not taking enough time on his hair...why would you want it to take longer than necessary? Omar's a great guy but I dont want to just hang out at the barber for longer than I need to. I get in, get out and on to enjoy the rest of my day.Amazing, consistent and quick hair cuts, with efficient scheduling. I love it",0

6/30/2016,0.09035087719298246,Positive,"Texted him asking for an appointment within the next 4 hours and he gave me one 20 minutes later. Like other reviews say, I recommend bringing a picture to get exactly what you want because of a small language barrier. I showed him what I wanted and he asked me a few follow up questions on length to ensure that I got what I wanted. He works extremely quickly--so quickly that I was worried he was rushing too much at the sacrifice of quality. By the end, however, I saw that this was one of the cleanest, well-styled haircuts I've ever had done by any barber. I've had worse and comparable haircuts for $40. A quick neck shave, shampooing, and hair styling is also done, free of charge. Price point is great at $20, too.The place is cash only, but Omar and his assistant were very accommodating, letting me drive over to an ATM a few minutes away when the one next door was out of order. He sent me off with a fist bump, and now I'm sure I'll be back soon.",0
8/21/2016,0.1387218045112782,Positive,"Rushes through every haircut, only takes a maximum of 10 minutes to cut your hair before quickly ushering you to his assistant who wears rubber gloves to wash your hair, he doesn't even bother to style anymore. The guy can't hear or communicate correctly with his clients and isn't interested enough to listen in the first place, he just wants to move to the next client.You get what you pay for, an extra 15 at a real salon gets you an hour long cut with clean fresh equipment and nice brand name products. Omar is so busy he texts during your appointment and doesn't even take the time to clean his work area or equipment from the previous clients hair. It's all a numbers game to him now and the only benefit would be if you were in an emergency and needed a haircut right away, otherwise I would go elsewhere.",0
1/23/2016,0.19347826086956524,Positive,"Omar is definitely one of the best barbers I have been to. Omar works out of Kija Hair Salon (independently I presume) and to make an appointment you just text him and he will give you an appointment time in a short amount of time with few words.  Omar does not have the best English and wears a hearing aid. He is a man of few words and uses a lot of hand signals to ask what you want. This does not really matter and is just something I noticed. It should not prevent you from going to him.Omar gives a great cut for $20 and only cuts men's hair. The easiest way to tell him how you want your hair is through a picture. Once you show him a picture, he'll have your hair cut in 10 minutes. He uses old-fashioned razors to trim sideburns, something I have never experienced at other places like Supercuts. Next, his assistant washes your hair and styles it for FREE! She also checks to make sure the haircut is perfect and symmetrical and tells Omar to fix it if she sees anything. Then, she styles your hair however you like. This experience is great for $20 and you'll be out the door within 30 minutes! This place is so much better than Supercuts which will cost $17.50 for a mediocre to bad cut and no wash. The extra $2.50 is definitely worth it to go to Omar!",0
7/4/2016,0.255,Positive,Omar does really good job. I have been to other place before Omar and they did a bad job but I found Omar on Yelp and went today . I loved the work he did to my hair and I would recommend Omar whoever is looking for a good barber,0

Hit him up with a text and he will find a time that works best for you as his schedule is really flexible. Be sure to come in knowing what you want. Once everything is figured out, his ability to cut hair is absolutely proficient. Not to mention how his ability to execute a fade is on point. For instance, I asked for a 0 to 1 fade today and it looked aesthetic AF after completion. Definitely one of the best cuts I got in years. Just a heads up, Omar only takes cash.",0

I've been looking for a quality, consistent barber at a reasonable rate for a VERY long time, so I lucked out when my buddy recommended me to Omar. This guy could easily land a job at a premier hair salon, and definitely charge more than what he does now, but I feel as though he lays low at Kija Salon so he can offer more cuts to more people in the Irvine community. Text him for an appointment and I guarantee he won't disappoint. He's a really cool dude too.",0

2/15/2016,-0.027336860670194016,Negative,"Omar's hair cut service is one that appears fashionable even though it was done fast. He also gives you a good first customer service impression. There were 3 people before me and he took less than 20 minutes to complete them. It is true what previous comment said about his fingers being 'dexterous'; but there are a few pointers that were lacking. One of which is precision.If you are looking for a regular barber/army/easy bald cut, he is definitely your guy. However if you are looking for more complicated cuts, which was what I was expecting from his fast cut, I am not sure whether he comprehend all the types of cut. It took more than a few minutes for him to picture what haircut I wanted. After he give it some thoughts, he went on cutting and after that his assistant washed my hair. However after my hair was dried, it is clear he missed a huge portion of the left sideburn of my hair, making it look weird and when his assistant pointed it out to him, he gave a distraught and uncomfortable/impatient look before making the changes. The left and right sideburn cuts were also not of the same cut. I just hoped he would try to slow down a bit to get things right without looking annoyed. Im not a perfectionist, but not caring/noticing for the weird imbalance cut is what makes this review not 5 stars.Another questionable thing is the rubber gloves his assistant is using. I did not see her changing them from the customers before me. Were they ever change between customers hair wash and hairstyling? Im not sure about this, but if it wasn't changed, hygiene might be another problem.In overall, I would recommend Omar and his fast haircut, but if you are looking for one which you can get an agreement easily on what type of fashionable cuts you look for, you might want to consider before going.",1

Fortunately, Omar was able to save me from looking shaggy at work! He was very responsive via text, and pleasant to work with. No chat, which I like, but he still managed to be more communicative than most barbers I've had: double checking to make sure I liked how high my hair was faded, and taking just enough off the top to make me look like an adult man and not a fuzzy puppy.

The second haircut I got was just fast along with sloppy and rushed. The fade I received was super uneven with random hairs that was sticking out. I had to clean it up back home. The 2nd haircut was also so super sloppy that my sideburns were off by half in inch. Probably one of the worst haircuts I've received in awhile. Omar is a good barber and I've only been here twice and shooting 50% from the free throw line isn't great. The price is excellent and the business owners are nice people, but you if want a little more attention and care towards your haircut, I'd advise you to go elsewhere.",0

First off, he doens't have a disability. You just need to look at him while you speak, he will clarify with you if there is any misunderstanding. He is very patient and will take his time working through your hair. Any special things you need, you'll have to tell him so he knows wassup. His speed, efficiency, and attention to detail is unprecedented especially for a $20 haircut. I love that he lines you up with a straight blade and will clean up any stray hairs that are prominent. The shampoo and styling for free are worth it too - let's you continue your day without having to go home and shower off.In conclusion, it's the best spot to get a quick haircut, shoot him a text for a quick appointment, and get lined up and a proper haircut. He's been consistent and the most easily bookable barber for the last 2 years without any fuss. Keep it up Omar - you're the man!",0

Started going to him a couple years ago because I found him off of Yelp and boy am I glad.  Aside from his incredible attention to detail, he is focused, hard working, and very flexible with scheduling appointments.  If you call him, he is likely working on somebody, so will text you back to schedule an appointment.  It's $20 cash for a 5 star haircut.  There is an ATM next door but save yourself the $3.75 and bring the cash with you.  Shampoo and rinse is included with the haircut.  I usually skip out on the gel he offers at the end of the haircut for those who like to style their hair.What makes him truly stand out is his appreciation for every customer.  One time, I left feeling like the top of my hair was still a little long for my liking, even though at the time I told him it's just how I like.  When I came back and he worked on my hair some more, he refused to accept money from me.  I've never gotten service like this elsewhere.Just a few days ago, I came in around lunch time and he wasn't there.  Upon texting him, he arrived within 10 or so minutes.  I offered to come back when it's more convenient for him, but he insisted there is no need.  This is his #1 priority.Good luck finding better out there!",0

5/20/2016,0.38459595959595966,Positive,Omar the barber is the man! For booking your appointment the best thing to do is to text him and he will get back to you ASAP. Also bring a photo of the hair style your interested in and he will flawlessly replicate it in minutes. I live in Downtown Los Angeles and I'll make a trip out to the OC to see him. He is great with a razor and will leave your neckline looking sharp. He really knows what he is doing and I highly recommend him to anyone!,0

11/29/2015,0.04210526315789473,Positive,"I was originally planning on going somewhere else but I had 2 friends who also wanted to get haircuts. Omar was nice enough to accept the 3 of us but failed to deliver on my cut. My friend's cut turned out great but mine was uneven. He used clippers on the sides but didn't bother checking for symmetry. Now my hair is awkwardly puffy on one side. To be fair, he did have to cut 3 people but 2 good cuts doesn't justify 1 bad cut. My friends may come back, but after my experience I rather invest my efforts somewhere else. I found this place when i searched for men's haircut but personally I think it feels out of place. Omar happens to be the only person there who cut men's hair and I'm assuming all the other workers work only on female. I was looking for satisfying cut but left disappointed. Hopefully, I can grow the sides out and go somewhere else to fix it.",0
4/9/2016,0.6375,Positive,Omar is an amazing barber! Did a great job on my cut! Definitely going to him from now on. Great price as well.,0

The guy knows what he is doing. Whatever I add on here wards will be just redundant, but seriously just try this barber. I finally have a nice hairstyle for once in my life.",0

He uses several clippers, scissors, a straight blade to touch up lines, washes my hair after, blows dries it and styles it. He does this all in about 20 minutes and does it better than any barber I have ever had. Not only that, he does all that for $20; it is fantastic. He is a very kind and friendly guy and making an appointment is simple, I shoot him a text in at advance and he gets back to me within 15 minutes; he is very accessible.I have read some reviews of people complaining that they didn't like their haircut; my suggestion is come in with a picture and be verbal throughout the process. Omar gets very focused on his work and he is not a mind reader, if you have a specific length you like something etc, you have to let him know; this is the case with any barber especially if it is your first time or two with the barber!",0

My first cut with him was really nice and I was excited that I found a great local barber.He is a total nice guy, but the second time I went to him, he totally let me down. I don't know why he cut the top of my head the way he did?!?! It was too late to stop him during the cut, and I was hoping that it would look better when I styled it at home the way I like.... Nope... I just can't figure out what to do with my hair now.I texted him that night and tried to explain to him that I wasn't happy at all to see how he would try to rectify the situation... All I gotwas a ""sorry bro"" reply. I usually don't like to write bad reviews, especially for a nice guy who is obviously talented and passionate about what he does, but the more I look at myself in the mirror, the more I feel like I have to vent my disapproval...",0

I recently moved to the OC from New York, and wanted to find someone to cut my hair. Nothing fancy. Just a regular hair cut. Omar is very good at what he does.

10/16/2013,0.3617676767676768,Positive,Omar is an excellent barber. I'm from Michigan and my barber in Michigan wrote down the clipper lengths that she used to cut my hair the way I like. When I showed Omar the note my barber wrote he motioned to put it away because he knew what he was doing.     I let Omar do his thing and Omar not only have me a better haircut than I had gotten in Michigan (sorry Katrina) but he also gave me an awesome beard trim. I don't how Omar is so handy with a razor but I highly recommend him if you want an awesome haircut and/or beard trim.    Also Omar and Selda are extremely friendly and I will definitely comeback when I need my hair cut again!,0

To me it seems that America is not very concerned with style, so every barber I had gone to just gave me an average haircut. After I got my haircut, I saw that Omar was even better than the European stylists! Omar has a natural talent for cutting hair, he does it quickly with great focus. One thing that made me very happy with Omar was that he used a razor to add a very clean cut. Never before had I seen a barber in America  use a razor until Omar.

4/21/2014,0.45254329004329014,Positive,Took my son here as it seems like we can never find a good barber to do his fade and line his edges.  Omar did a great job.  The front line up wasn't quite even but for some reason this seems like a hard things for most barbers to do.  I was happy with the haircut and Omar made a special appointment to accommodate our schedule which i thought was amazing as we were first time customers!  my son is very picky about his hair but he said he will go back.  So that's a win for Omar in my book!,0

8/5/2014,0.1392857142857143,Positive,"Omar knows his craft. You walk into this salon and at first you think, ""Is this a barber shop?"" The lady in the front (I presume a family member) asks, ""Are you here for Omar?"" You look around this empty Salon thinking, ""Where am I? Yes, Im here for Omar? This place is deserted.."" She calmly walks to the back and calls Omar. If you have seen the movie Troy, the first battle scene is Brad Pitt verses a Goliath of a man. Brad is in the near by town sleeping in a bed full of women when a young boy enters the room and calls Achillie's to come battle this beast in front of the two army's whom are wagering the battle on the outcome of the two mens fight.  Achillies stands up, shakes off the night and runs to battle, ultimately killing this man whom is 3 time's his size with one swift badass move. As Omar makes his appearance, this is the impression I was immediately stuck with. FYI Omar is Deaf, but some how can understand everything you ask him an executes it to precision. Ive come back to Omar 4 times since my first cut and will most likely continue as long as im based in OC.",0
