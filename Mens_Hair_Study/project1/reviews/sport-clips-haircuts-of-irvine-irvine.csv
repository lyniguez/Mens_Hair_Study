Customer service is 100% Staff is 100% authenticPlace is SOOO cleanFirst time customers like myself get massage, hot towels on your face, and head wash!Most places try to cut down costs but these guys (thank you Spencer) go all out on their customers. Although I move to NYC now, whenever I go to Irvine, I will ONLY get haircut at this place. Or other Sports clips. Y'all the best. My head looking fresh and my rate with ladies increased too haha!",0
9/14/2017,0.12831632653061223,Positive,"Low integrity business. Haircuts are ok, but be careful.I used to go to this Sportclips in Woodbury, Irvine and had been going for years. I came here when Kristen and Rosie and Xuan were here, all of them gone now. I got to know the stylists. Recently, I found out stylists were leaving for multiple reasons. The owners put the screws on the stylists to do volume over quality haircuts. Their whole system is being reworked to give 20 minutes to complete an MVP haircut and the stylists are basically punished for actually spending time to do it right. Popular stylists would have really long wait times because they refuse to do appointments or even phone-aheads anymore.Finally i decided to leave but i had just bought a season ticket. Now they won't give me my money back. They took my name and number and told me the owner would call me about a refund. Yeah right. Never happened after months of waiting. I know other folks that went here too and same thing happened to them.",0
12/27/2017,0.41428571428571426,Positive,Got the MVP with M&M. She was the sweetest and most knowledgeable person I have ever had my hair cut by. She seems to really enjoy what she does and actually listens to what you want done with your hair instead of doing what she thinks is best. The best hair cut I've had in a while. Will definitely come back.,0

Today I had my hair cut by Sophia and she made my good experience into an excellent one. She was very sweet and made sure I had the best experience possible. She's also very knowledgeable about hair and hair treatment. I learned how to keep my hair moisturized with the teatree products and I look forward to using the bottle I bought. Sophia made this an excellent visit and I look forward to seeing her in the future!,0

It does get packed on the weekends but they they have a lot of staff so you know that they are being as efficient as they can be.All of the stylists here are very personable and do a pretty decent job cutting hair. I personally have my favorite in Ruby. She is friendly, down to earth and knows how to cut my hair to my liking. I only wish they took reservations online or over the phone. Otherwise, two thumbs up!",0

The one on Chipman Road in Lee's Summit run by Jenn has been the absolute best. The store is always clean and orderly and all of the stylists are very friendly. I've had the chance to use several different stylists and they all provide great haircuts consistently. Each time I go, I get the MVP service which includes the haircut, hair wash, hot towel facial, and neck massage. Each time I leave I look and feel like a million bucks. Thanks Jenn & team.

7/12/2017,0.27222222222222225,Positive,Ruby does an excellent job. We have tried a few different hair styles and each time they end up looking great. I have spent a lot of money over the years at different upscale salons/barbers/hairdressers and Ruby gives a superior cut. Pick up the season pass if you go in. It is definitely worth it and will save you money in the long run.,0

9/14/2017,0.2291053921568628,Positive,"Stopped in Sports Clips Woodbury today for a much needed haircut.  Had a ""buddy card"" from a friend which entitled me to a free haircut with an ""MVP"" upgrade!  I've never been to Sports Clips before and I didn't know what to expect.  I t was pretty slow (lunchtime) so I didn't have to wait.  Barbie greeted me and showed me how to check myself in and explained what my ""buddy card"" got me.  She also told me all about Sports Clips and how they operate.  She was a great ambassador for the brand.  She also did a great job cutting my hair!  MVP package gets you a hot towel face massage as well as a scalp / head massage and a quick shoulder massage with a little hand-held massager.  Not the best massage, but heck, its a haircut!  I would certainly go back and ask for Barbie if I did, she was kind and easy to talk to and was very accommodating when I kept asking her to ""go a little shorter""!",0

I appreciate good customer service and because of that I am changing the rating to a four star. Everyone makes mistakes but the important thing is how you fix the mistake.

With the 6 people standing at the front desk, not a single person acknowledged myself or my son. After about a minute, a lady walked in and was instantly greeted by the staff while we were still being ignored. THEN the kicker. A man walks in after her and he is also greeted and a sign in sheet is finally placed on the counter in front of him. We walked out after that. Just because we are there for a kids cut, which is cheaper, doesn't mean we should be ignored.",1

I usually go to traditional barbershops to cut my hair because I am super picky and precise with my hair. But, Billie at Sports Clips cut my hair even better than my original barber. She is very charming, professional, courteous, and most of all had the best customer service skills that I have ever encountered. We had a very fun conversation and the whole experience was top notch. I am going to recommend EVERYONE I know to get their hair cut by Billie!!! Thanks again for making my day :D",0

No, no, no.  So today, a straight forward haircut is the way to go.  Thank you SportClips! Plus, I want to applaud SportClips for having a Dani.

I signed in on the computer but noticed that my youngest didn't have his name as a family member under my husbands name. No big deal, I just added his name. When its time for their haircut, my older son was helped by the lady who seems friendly and polite. They had a record for from his previous haircut so I told them that he will get the same haircut. When it was my younger sons turn since his name was not on the computer, I decided to ask the lady helping my older son what number clip she was going to use for my older son. Im not sure why but she answered tersely and seemed not interested in helping all of a sudden. The lady that was helping my younger son just shrugged her shoulders and asked her again. Again she answered in a very terse tine with no rye contact. I thought it weird and rude at the same time. The only thing I can think of is hat she did not like the other lady helping my younger son. I wanted to speak to the manager discreetly but come to find out she was the manager. Its too bad. Hopefully we just caught her at a bad day.",1

7/9/2015,0.05859523809523808,Positive,"I've come to this location faithfully for over a year, since moving to Irvine.  USUALLY the service I get is top notch, the haircut is clean and I leave happy.But today I received service so appalling that I will not be returning.A few months back I was given a reward punch card of sorts, which allows you to receive half off your 6th haircut.  The last time that I had gotten a haircut here, I received my fifth punch and was told by my stylist that I would get my next one half off.So I thought that I'd treat myself today to an MVP, with shampoo, massage and hot towel.  After all, being that tomorrow is my birthday I thought it would be the perfect way to relax.Well, apparently Xuan ( my hair stylist ) had other ideas.Upon entering the location there was a minimal wait as usual, and I greeted her with the punch card, happily stating that I wanted to get the MVP and that I would be receiving half off.  She informed me that I was misinformed, and that I had to purchase 6 haircuts to get the 7th one half off. At this point I really should have taken a closer look at the card or asked for another stylist.  But instead I shoved the card back into my pocket and requested a regular haircut.During my haircut Xuan was really insistent to try to ""sell"" me things I didn't need.  I was already a bit irritated about the misinformation regarding my reward card, so I didn't want to spend MORE money.  She asked me a total of 5 times to buy the season pass, which I didn't want.  And 3 times if I wanted to buy the MVP at full price, also not what I wanted.  I will concede though, that the haircut was at least halfway decent.After the cut, I pulled the reward card back out of my pocket to give to Xuan to receive my sixth stamp.  I re-read the card carefully, and sure enough it stated ""GET HALF OFF YOUR 6TH CUT"".  I thought that perhaps I had miscounted the punches but indeed, there was 5.I showed this to Xuan, and explained to her that the card states your 6th cut is half off.Now at this point, a simple apology and offer to continue the MVP would have been enough to put me back in a happy place.  Unfortunately for me, that's not what occurred.Xuan swiftly grabbed my card and asked "" You want me to wash your hair or not?!""Now, I don't take lightly to receiving horrible attitude, especially when a store employee is so clearly in the wrong.  I decided not to take her up on her offer.""No, Xuan.  I think I'd just like to pay and leave. ""As she circled the counter she said, "" Normally this is not how it works.  But if this is what YOU want then I'll give it to you."" Really, her extremely abrasive attitude surprised and shocked me.  I don't normally engage in a disgruntled employee but I felt that the mistake should be corrected."" This isn't about what I want, Xuan.  Look at the card.  It clearly states my 6th cut is half off, and this is my 6th cut.  I mean, after all what's right is right. ""She looked up again at me and quickly snapped "" Its okay, this is what you want.  Its okay, "" as she took my payment.I couldn't help but shake my head at the complete, utter and appalling lack of service I was receiving from Xuan.  She shoved my change back over to me without uttering a word, then turned around and walked away.A word of advice to management:I've been in sales and service for over 10 years.  I know what it takes to deal with customers on a daily basis.  The way that XUAN handled me was completely unacceptable and has lost your location a dedicated customer.  And I was in no way being a difficult customer, in fact, I was pretty cheerful before entering this location and looking forward to celebrating my birthday this coming weekend.If she is not reprimanded eventually for her lack of customer service skills, she may cost your business many clients.  Perhaps a simple customer service training is in order for her?  Either way, something must be done.Further more, I don't usually do this, but I will be contacting management in an effort to make her lack of service skills known as well.- Add On Edit -Spoke with manager Stacy who profusely apologized and offered a free MVP upgrade the next time I was in.  She was extremely pleasant over the phone and was working hard to make things right.  Perhaps I may visit this location again, although I will specifically ask to NOT be helped by Xuan.Updated review to 2 stars instead of one.",0

Many times the ""stylist"" would dive right after the clippers with the preset length comb attached and hack away like a gardener. It's a  fact that different franchisees either take their business seriously and insure the staff is well trained or they drop the ball completely. I can emphatically state that this particular shop was top notch and delivered excellent service. I was so impressed with the Woodbury location in Irvine that I recommended them to friends  (which I  rarely ever do for personal services). The staff was professional, friendly and asked all the right questions. They didn't rush through the process and they genuinely cared.The franchise should take note and follow their lead.Good job!",0

This would be 5 stars if it was just for Rosie.  However She usually has a long wait.  When she is not there it is hit or miss and I mean miss. It seems like it is due to having a large turnover of staff. Some of the stylist are constantly trying to sell you something. Whether it is an upgrade on the cut or hair products. Some are a little bit over aggressive.  Also if you call for a particular stylist you can not put your name down. Therefore you have to usually wait.,1

Decent cut but the wait for them just to enter my info in their system is kind of a hassle but overall better than waiting at some places where normal wait time is 30 minutes or more.

My whole life stylists butchered my hair and forced me to buy lots of goopy product to correct their shoddy work. Xuan cut my hair so well that for the first time in my life I did not need any gels or glues to keep my hair in place. She is a rare find and I highly recommend getting your hair cut by her.

2/16/2014,-0.012979797979797996,Negative,"Here's the deal. I don't come here for the sports conversation with women who clearly don't know about sports. The forced sports conversation is awkward and unnecessary. I come here for a good haircut because it is convenient to where I live.I've had a mixed experience. I've had a few good haircuts but the person would end up leaving the store, or moving away. Then I'd get someone else who wouldn't do a good job at all. I have a basic haircut, a number 1 clipper blended into a number 2. This has proven to be a challenge for many of the women. I've had to come back in on more than one occasion to fix it as spots where missed.Last time I went in I drew some miserable lady who did not want to be there. At least she didn't talk about sports with me. I had to ask her to fix things while in the chair. I left and my wife noticed another spot she missed on the back of my head. I went back in and the receptionist said I would have to wait because they were busy and people had already called in...well I already called in earlier, got a lousy haircut and just need a quick fix. She also said they are closing within the hour and I should probably come back tomorrow in a very annoyed tone...how's that for service...are you reading this management??I don't have time for that nonsense so I got it fixed somewhere else.Bottom line, you may get a decent haircut, but make sure you stick with that person because most of the people there are hit or miss. They also put on a hard sell with the season pass offer they have. It's quite off putting, they must make commission on it. I know other guys that will not buy it just simply because they hate the hard sell, myself included.",1
8/2/2015,0.10833333333333334,Positive,Pros:-decent quality haircut-clean environment-season ticket makes it easier because you don't have to pull out the wallet at every cut.Cons:-really long wait times; actual wait times are significantly longer (25-45 mins longer) than estimated.-crowded waiting area.-20-25% pricier than Supercuts.

Sports Clips does a great job keeping customer information regarding past cuts, which is helpful because my brother can never remember what he had done before.  Billy also made sure he was happy with every step of the haircut, asking each step to ensure he liked the way it looked!

I've lost trust in barber shops/hair salons throughout the years and have been doing my hair myself. I'm so extremely glad I stopped by. You have a choice from: an MVP cut that includes a haircut, steamed towel for your face, a scalp massage when rinsing your hair, and a back massage. Note: You get a free upgrade to this on your first visit. You get charged for just a normal haircut. Or a normal haircut. The atmosphere is of course is like you're in a locker room for sports, but more aesthetically pleasing. Laurin cut my hair. SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING, unlike all of the barbers that have ever cut my hair. I walked out of there LOVING my hair. She went above and beyond what I expected. This is the first time that has ever happened to me. Thank you so much Laurin! Tip: They also do mini clean ups for your hair for free as long as your hair doesn't need a haircut.

After another 10 minutes of sitting there I went back up and asked how much longer it was going to be and she quoted me another 15 minutes.

I proceeded to wait almost an hour as five other guests were taken ahead of me. There is no point to walk in and expect to be serviced when almost every cut is done off a call in system. I called 20 min before stopping by inquiring about prices and wait times. The girl on the phone said it would be a 20 min wait time currently. I said I am a new customer and would be heading down now. WHY DID SHE NOT OFFER TO TAKE MY NAME AND PUT IT ON THE CALL LIST? SINCE THIS IS HOW ALMOST ALL CUTS ARE DONE!!! I arrived at the location and it was now a 30 min wait. I said ok and proceeded to wait. As I sat there my blood began to boil after 30 min had passed and 3 people who walked in were taken before me since they called in. After almost an hour waiting the fifth customer walks in and waits 3 min and get taken before me. That was the last straw and I walked out. There is no point to walk in with out a call in.

2/18/2010,0.3216666666666667,Positive,"This was my first non-Supercuts haircut experience in at least 6-7 years, and I have to admit that I had a great time.  As this was my first time at a Sport Clips, the stylist gave me the MVP haircut for the price of a regular cut ($18), which includes a haircut, shampoo, hot towel wrapped around your face, and a back and shoulder massage.  The haircut was great, and my stylist was very knowledgeable, though I don't remember her name (I think it was Michelle or Shelly).  She told me that she also worked at a high-priced salon, so that was reassuring.  The hot towel and shampoo felt very nice, and though coming from a Division III school, I didn't care for the college basketball that was on the TVs, it was a nice change to listening to KOST 103.5 at Supercuts.  The massage is a bit overrated; they just put a buffer attachment on what appears to be a power drill and it massages your neck and shoulders.One cool thing they said they would do is touch up my sideburns and neck for free between haircuts.  I don't know if I would wait in line for that, but it's at least a nice option.The prices are reasonable, the staff is really friendly, and I really like my haircut, so I guess it was a great first experience.",0

Let me just say, Sarah has been doing my hair for some time and is the absolute best. I always get the feeling she is providing great quality haircuts and as I frequently go here for MVP, I leave very satisfied. However. This weekend I came in and it was quite busy as usual (make sure you call ahead of time on weekends). I got this lady that I did not recognize. I am assuming she is a new stylist or something. From start to finish she seemed extremely rushed, and the haircut was sub par at best. Maybe I've been spoiled from my previous experiences but this time I was stunned that it was as if she was trying to get me through as fast as possible. The haircut overall did not feel refined as it usually does like the ones I get with previous stylists. I must say I was extremely disappointed with this experience. I am giving this location the benefit of the doubt to say this was unique to this certain stylist.

7/27/2012,0.07411967418546367,Positive,"The wait times at this place are RIDICULOUS. I've been going to it for about a year and had a few times that I walked out with the hair above my ears being cut waaaaaay to high. Other times, I have gone there and received a great cut.. It's really up to your luck of the draw.. one HUGE gripe that I have with it. OK, the girls generally do an alright job (considering that I basically like the sides buzzed and the top a little longer I don't think that's really saying much..), but the management is horrible. Let me outline why:You cannot call and request someone that you trust to cut your hair. I've tried this and at times it's gone through, and others it has been a ""we're sorry, but we don't do that"" type of a thing.You cannot call ahead more than THEIR wait time to get your cut scheduled. For instance, I called today to ask what the wait time is, and was told that there was no wait. After hear this I looked at my watch - it was 11. I told the girl that picked up that I could be there in 20-30 minutes, and to please put me on the list so that I won't have to wait. Her response: ""Call back in 15 minutes so that I can put you on the list.""  - right when I got in I signed the sheet and had to wait another 20 minutes to get my haircut because some guy walked in ten minutes after me and had called ahead... I wasn't too happy.I've gone in during my lunch HOUR after calling ahead and had to wait an hour and a half (I only did this once) when I when I was told it would be 30-40 minutes.  Oh, and I would never suggest going here on a weekend.In summary: Only go to this place if you have a ton of time to kill and you don't mind that they have a horrible system for managing appointments. They have some type of rule about not taking appointments for 15 minutes after the general wait time. This means that if you are lucky enough to call when they are empty, you should probably already be standing outside the door to get on the list. If you work more than 15 minutes away you will be told to call back within 15 minutes of arrival.. I hope this system sounds a bit broken to more people than just me..I would just like to say that the girls that work here are generally at least nice (I have never met this Lauren girl), and that I wouldn't have a problem going here if they would fix the system and allow me to choose someone that can always cut my hair. As is, it's pretty amazing that this place has so many customers..",0

You can call ahead and out your name in so usually very little wait time. It's nice when you have a minute to get the MVP with the head massage it's great. I will continue to come here as long as I live in the area. As good as it gets for the price!,0

3/10/2014,0.5772727272727273,Positive,"I am not sure about the place overall...but I know that I follow this one haircut lady around to every new company she goes to because she is the best. She use to work at Supercuts at the Spectrum where I went to see her there for Years, then she went to Sportsclips and I followed her there. If you go to the one in Woodbury, ask for Swan, she is the best. I will not let any one there cut my hair except for her, and when I do my wife can tell. One thing I do like about Sportsclips is their MVP...I think its one best franchises I have been to for a haircut.",0
7/9/2013,0.5333333333333333,Positive,"I really love this place.  I've going there for about 6 months and I see Natalie every time.  She has a great personality, but more importantly she cuts my hair the way I like it and does it the same way each time.  I find it when she's working and then call ahead to put my name on the list.  Very happy here!",0

6/28/2013,0.41250000000000003,Positive,I have been coming to this location for a couple years now and i only see Rosie. She is an amazing stylist that gives me a great cut consistently.,0
8/16/2012,-0.04150793650793651,Negative,"Seriously, this place s so poorly managed.  I have been there about 4 times for my son's haircuts and they have never estimated wait times correctly.  I understand being off by 5-10 minutes since it's ""walk-in"" establishment, but they have been off by 15-30 minutes every single time!  Once the gal we were told to wait for arrived at the salon 15 minutes late, then proceeded to set up her station for the next 15 minutes before she even called to help us.  It's my own fault for thinking it would be different or better  and continuing to go back.  I filled out an online survey expressing my disappointment and the manager called me once, missed me and eft a message.  I have called her back twice and she has still never connected with me.  Honestly, this place is the pits. I have given up on going back there.  Boo on Sport Clips for horrible service!",1
7/8/2012,0.2711363636363636,Positive,"I don't know why I have gone to this place more than once. Actually...I do, it's because it is about a mile away from my house, it's cheap and I'm lazy.I've been here four times, and only twice received a haircut. The other two times I went, once on a Tuesday afternoon and another on a Sunday afternoon, both had wait times of over an hour. Tip: if you are going to try this place out, call ahead. The two cuts I did get were OK. Nothing great, but what can you expect for $20. Also, it's advertised as a place to get your hair cut and watch sports; however, the two times I was getting my haircut there the TVs were showing the sports history channel or something, even though I know there were live games playing at those times. But hell, I would have taken that over listening to the early 20s girl cutting my hair telling be about the best donuts she had in NY and how she couldn't wait to save up her money and travel the world. I'd take watching the biography of Bobby Feller any day over that. Anyway, I'm done trying to make this place work because it's in close proximity to my house. I going somewhere else.",0
6/16/2013,0.3125,Positive,"I have been going to this place for 4 years every 2 weeks.   Love this place.  Elaina is great.   Sports, friendly staff, shampoos w hot towel and message.   Sometimes the wait can be long but not a big deal.",0
11/4/2014,0.25,Positive,"I've alternate between here and another location but I think I'll be coming here more often. I've never been disappointed by the quality of the haircuts here. The last couple of times, Mary cut my hair and she did a great job. Very happy with the whole experience.",0
9/21/2012,0.0,Negative,Lady at front desk needs a lesson in courtesy and customer service. Take your business to somewhere that values it. Her arrogance reminds me of cable companies in the 80s. My advice:  find another place for an affordable haircut. I won't be coming back no matter what.,1
12/20/2011,0.010000000000000009,Positive,Lauren is rude! Didn't even know she is the manager until I started reading the reviews in Yelp.  There is a reason why I am not the only person who thinks Lauren needs to learn a few things about courtesy. We are not going back here for sure!,0
12/31/2015,0.0517156862745098,Positive,"Worst Customer service experience EVER!!!!!  We walk in at 6:00 pm and the young lady did not say hello, we will be with you in a min... No greeting at ALL not even eye contact... Not sure if she saw we had little ones that needed a hair cut and just did not want to do it, but she could not of made it more obvious that we were unwanted there... To make sure I was not over reacting I gave the young lady the benefit of the doubt and said she is with a customer but a HELLO would of been nice or we will be with you shortly, no customer service training....  After waiting 15 min and my kids getting inpatient she finish with the customer walks up front and looks at me and my kids with a straight face no smile no hello... and then FINALLY says we will be with you shortly... Charges the customer and walks back and start cleaning... I GET it she has to clean but how can we help you, what did you need today... I do apologize for the wait NOTHING... never going there again and I do plan to contact the manager.  At the end and after waiting it was clear this is not a place for kids.. We walked out and we will never go there again.",0
3/1/2014,0.2,Positive,"The only reason I give this place a 5 is because of Xuan.  She is the best and the only person who knows how to cut my hair.  I am moving a bit further away, but still plan on coming back so she can cut my hair.",0
12/2/2011,0.1785714285714286,Positive,Love it here!  My son gets his hair cut by Laurin.  She's so sweet with him and gentle and he loves her.  He's been traumatized by other places that I won't name (rhymes with shupermuts) and Laurin is always careful and gentle with him.  They are obviously busy on the weekends but offer call ahead service.,0

But...Hey - it's cheap - under $20, and my girfriend hasn't left me yet (that I know of), so if you can resist the seductive powers of the upsell - come on by!",0
6/15/2014,0.2864583333333333,Positive,This is my go-to place for haircuts for almost 6 years now.  I always ask for Rosie because she gets my cut exactly how I want it.  The entire staff is also always very friendly!,0
9/15/2009,0.2433116883116883,Positive,"I've been alternating between SuperCuts and Christopher Salon 2.  So, a low end place, and a high end place.  I figure it balances out the budget and I don't feel so bad alternating.  Anyway, I decide to try Sport Clips.  I've played all sports, but I don't regularly watch professional sports, although live games are fun.  But, I thought the concept was kind of fun.  Glenda was my stylist.  She did a great job explaining all the options, and I went with MVP.  It was worth it for $23 and a very good haircut.  I'm sure I'll be back.",0
3/24/2013,0.275,Positive,"I had a coupon for a free MVP haircut so I thought I'd try out the local Sport Clips. Didn't call ahead so I was told it would be about 45 minutes. Actually, they were able to see me in about 20 minutes which isn't bad since you have a flat screen TV for sports and ""Guys magazines"" ( not the usual People, Cosmo, Vanity Fair, etc, thank goodness).Lara was my barber. She was very personable and did a great job! My wife liked the haircut, so you know it was good!",0
1/8/2014,0.2840909090909091,Positive,I have been in CA for a year and no one comes close to the great hair cut that Lynn gave. I found my new hair stylist. Thanks Lynn I will be back.,0
2/26/2009,0.06250000000000003,Positive,I took my little man here this morning to get his 2nd REAL haircut for a wedding tomorrow. His hair tends to curl after it grows out a bit and it's a mess to control. So since we can literally walk there from the house we headed here. At 10:30am the wait was 20 minutes but with 2nd st beauty next door I didn't mind. The haircut itself went well. He sat still and let the lady (didn't catch her name) do her work. She trimmed him up and made it look good. Although I was not as pleased as with the other place (Hair Master's or something like that..idk) it works. She did however comb his hair on top to the side to make him look like a little metro sexual but with a little water and a comb mommy fixed his do in the car. Oh yeah we paid 14 bucks plus tip. Not too bad.,0
10/17/2009,0.3833333333333333,Positive,"Nice mid priced place to get your hair cut. Been there a few times now and have liked all my cuts.  I prefer a nice barber shop, but hey try to find a good one in Irvine.",0

3/25/2014,0.0,Negative,Way overpriced for kids cuts.  And no toys kids movies nada to help distract them. But my boyfriend likes it bc theres espn ad nauseum surrounding you.  So i guess its worth $35 if ur a sports fanatic.,1

7/16/2014,0.2618055555555556,Positive,"$19 for a buzz haircut. ok fine, hopefully its a good one. i normally pay $10 to $15 for this. i like the #1 metal blades, not the plastic blade guide. they don't have the metal blades, now I'm really bummed. at the end of my cut i tell them this:  they charge more than other places for buzz cut and that all good barber shops have metal blades. she was really defensive which was more annoying. instead of using the information i just gave her to improve their business. she says, ""we are not a barber shop, we're sport clips"" with a name like sport clips you would think.......anyways thanks for pointing that out, i will not return.",0
1/3/2011,0.25260416666666663,Positive,"My 6-year-old went here for a quick trim while we were on vacation, and came back with the best haircut he has ever had!  I was thrilled -- for 14 bucks plus tip, the stylist (Rosie, I think?) gave him a great cut with a nice jagged look in the front, so he avoided the ""Dumb and Dumber"" look that can come with a lot of boys' haircuts.  And better yet, she taught my husband and son how to tame that crazy cowlick and make it behave instead of sticking up all the time.  It was great!  Would definitely go back -- especially because the boys were happy to watch the game while they were there.  Terrific all around.",0
3/22/2011,0.41500000000000004,Positive,When my barber for 20 + years passed away I wasn't sure where to go. A buddy told me about sport clips and their VIP package. I figured I'd try them out and was pleasantly surprised. I've been going to them for over a year now. Courteous and friendly staff that knows how I like my hair cut....I can't ask for much more. I just wish they would take appointments.,0
