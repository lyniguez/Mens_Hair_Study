3/4/2018,0.3931818181818182,Positive,I live nearby and come here regularly. Bo is a kind person and I like to talk with him. Their coloring service is good too. Don't forget to try out some new styles and update your life.,0
9/16/2017,-0.014795918367346924,Negative,Whoa.. I thought I was coming in for a $20 haircut but ended up paying $30+$5 tip. This is ten dollars more than I expected. The haircut wasn't half bad but was slightly more messy than I get from other places and the guy cutting my hair kept saying how he was certain he knew what I wanted. The price really made me feel like this wasn't worth it and I'm not gonna come back for this price.Update: just came back home and noticed that the barber completely missed some parts of the back of my head. See photos. This essentially is a deal breaker for me. I felt like I just wasted $35. I'm essentially gonna have to go over my hair with a pair of scissors to clean up the mistakes of this barber...Super frustrating. I can't recommend you go here. Dropped to one star.,1
10/5/2017,-0.25,Negative,I was here in June and had the worst haircut and highlights. I had to have another salon fix the highlights. When I left the stylist told me she didn't like my color and to come back in 4 weeks so she could give me something better. It was awful and I will never go back.,1
11/13/2017,0.15928124999999999,Positive,I came here about a few weeks ago and had my haircut and color. I was nervous about getting my hair colored at first because I'm a 28 year old male with lots of grey but I wanted it to look natural. I showed her some pictures and she was very attentive and she got it spot on perfect! I've been to a few other places before and left looking over dyed and my hair was either cut too short or not enough and the stylists never seemed to listen but Ana was very helpful and attentive... I've been coming to this salon to get my hair done every few weeks and also my girlfriend has gotten her hair straightened and it's cut and color and we always left looking great! Definitely recommend for anyone out there looking for a stylist that can make your hair looking exactly the way you always wanted!!,0
9/26/2016,0.2523171368861024,Positive,"I decided to give this place a try since my boyfriend has been coming here for 8 years and he's always been happy with the quality of the service :) The salon is located in the plaza with Albertsons, Mokkoji, Tang 190, Starbucks, and plenty of other convenient stores and yummy restaurants. I'm usually a little hesitant to change up where I go to get my hair cut because it's hard to know what you'll end up with but I'm really glad I decided to come here!!The staff are all really friendly and you can tell that the stylists really care about keeping their clients satisfied and happy. With any haircut, they shampoo and condition your hair. The whole salon was very clean and the seats were pretty comfortable too. They did a very thorough wash and she even gave me some deep conditioner that made my hair feel SUPERRR SOFT. As an added bonus, the shampoo smelled amazing too. I came because I needed to get rid of some of the weight and dead ends on my hair along with a slight trim for my bangs and they did a perfect job! My stylist kept checking during my haircut to make sure everything was to my liking and really paid attention to the photos I showed her of how I wanted my bangs to lookThe prices are fair too considering I have really long hair and also how picky I am.. heh :)I'd definitely recommend this to anyone, even if you're afraid of trying somewhere new.",0
9/24/2016,0.3145833333333333,Positive,I wanted to get my nieces a nice haircut experience but it didn't end well. They told me it was $25 for kids cuts and when we went to pay they overcharged me. My niece even pointed out there's sign that states kids under 12 are $25. She's 9.When I asked the older lady to trim the top of her front hair because it was too long she almost started arguing with me that she's not finished. Wow. Zero customer service. Liars. My 5 year old niece had a nice guy cut her hair and she enjoyed her hair cut and she was $25.,0
11/19/2017,-0.09999999999999999,Negative,If I could give zero stars I would. Hair stylist was 20 minutes late. Tried to talk me out of what I wanted. Then told me that they couldn't do what I wanted contrary to what I was initially told. Ended up just getting my head buzzed all over. Was charged 30 dollars for something I could do myself. NEVER COMING BACK.,1
10/1/2016,0.31346153846153846,Positive,"Moving to Orange County from South East Aisa. One of my biggest heartaches about leaving my City was leaving my stylist. Having had one too many bad haircuts and finding somebody I adored, I've been super hesitant to try anyone here. I haven't had my hair colored nor cut for a long time, and I wanted to get close to my original hair color. Started doing my researched and these seems like a convenient place to go. I called made an appointment. I got there and met my stylist Lucy.  She made me feel very comfortable! She did a fantastic job! My first time I've left a salon happy with my hair.  I recommend going here and seeing Lucy for color and cut!Other notes:The salon itself is Clean, beautiful and modern without feeling stuffy.",0
4/10/2017,0.40087412587412585,Positive,I had a Digital Setting Perm done by Ana and it was absolutely amazing. The service was incredible. She offered me so many drinks and snacks to help pass the time and I felt that I always had her full undivided attention. She took such good care of my hair and made sure to treat it well throughout the process so that it did not get damaged during the process. My curls came out just the way I wanted and I couldn't be happier. I had such a great experience that I plan on coming here every time for my hair even though I live quite far from the shop. Couldn't ask for a better experience!,0
4/8/2017,0.16766975308641976,Positive,"I've been having my hair done by Lucy for the past few years, and I couldn't recommend her more.  I get bored easily with my hair--every few months I crave a change.  Lucy has cut my hair by several inches, given me bangs, and changed my hair style--every time with amazing results.  Today she saved me--she was extremely busy and last night I made the mistake of trying to save money by cutting my own bangs.  The results looked like a preschooler had cut my hair while I slept--I never knew it was possible to be that bad at cutting your own bangs.  I called Hair Days and pleaded with Lucy to save me.  She squeezed me in between clients and did a phenomenal job of repairing the damage, in about 3 minutes flat!  I learned my lesson, next time I'll just pay the $5 for a bang trim, lol.  Lucy is talented, professional, honest, and friendly.  Also the prices at Hair Days are fairly reasonable, considering the area.  I love getting my hair done by Lucy, it's always a great experience!",0
8/27/2017,0.1,Positive,Price is never the same! First time I got charged 20$ second time 25$ third time 23$. And forth 30$. And they don't have prices written anywhere in their salon. So when you get done get ready for the surprise for the price!,0
10/3/2017,0.3041666666666667,Positive,"Best haircut place around! I highly recommend Lucy! She's my favorite and I've been coming to her for 12 years! You can't get a better haircut anywhere else. If you come, ask for Lucy, you won't be disappointed!! :)",0
8/13/2017,0.40511363636363634,Positive,"Lucy is the best! I've been going to her for the past year and have loved each cut she has done for me. If you're a guy looking for a new stylist, schedule an appointment with her!",0
7/11/2017,0.12045454545454547,Positive,"I came in to see Ana to get cut, color, and a keratin treatment. I'm sooooooo pleased with the way it turned out and she was incredibly attentive to my needs. At other salons I feel like the stylist does what they want to my hair without listening to what I want...but Ana was so spot on. I showed her a picture of this balayage I really wanted and she matched the color exactly to the picture. The keratin treatment gave my hair body and a slight wave while also making it look and feel sooo shiny and soft. It's been a few days since my appointment and I still don't have to style my hair in the mornings before work. She is seriously a God send. Definitely 100% recommend anyone to go see Ana, you will be in good hands.",0
7/18/2017,0.4534090909090909,Positive,This place is the best. I have been coming here for years. I used to bounce around between fantastic sams and Supercuts but I'll be going here as long as I live! Lucy is the absolute best in the business. Thank you!,0
10/22/2016,0.4371666666666667,Positive,"I've been coming to Hair Days for about two years now and I have not had a bad hair cut in two years. My girl, Lucy, always does a great job and knows how to cut my hair to make it look good even if I do not know exactly what I want. I get a compliment and get asked about my hair cut literally every time I get a cut.The place is clean, modern, and the staff are friendly. Also, Lucy gives the best advice for those who need it. A warning though, she is very honest so don't ask her for advice if you don't want to hear the honest truth.",0
8/5/2017,0.3055555555555555,Positive,"Quality is what you get here. I personally see Bo to cut my hair and he never fails to give me exactly what I want. This guy knows what he's doing, and will explain what he's doing as well. Wonderful service, hardly ever have to wait. Love this place!",0
5/22/2017,0.08988715277777777,Positive,"What a gem this little salon is! It's not super fancy... but for a simple wash/blow dry I would recommend in a heartbeat. I called on Saturday morning in a scramble to get my hair washed, blow dried and flat ironed.. after getting completely price gouged at another nearby salon. The other salon was going to charge me $95 for a simple wash/blow dry. I knew it was a long shot but decided to give Hair Days a call to see if they could squeeze me in at the last minute. I spoke with Wendy and she asked how soon I could be there. I told her 5 minutes... and she said come on in. Wendy was so super sweet and did a phenomenal job! She washed my hair twice, conditioned... and then blow dried and flat ironed my hair. It turned out absolutely gorgeous! It took her less than 40 minutes for the whole thing... and this is the best part... she only charged $30!!!!!! I will definitely be going back!",0
7/3/2016,0.2425,Positive,"I am very glad that I found this place. I take my hair pretty seriously and I would not let people cut my hair until I find a barber that know what he or she is doing. The hairstyle I go to is Jerry. He is very cautious and pays great attention to details. I pay $25 and he spends a good amount of time cutting, washing, and styling my hair. He is definitely the man to go to if you need a fresh, clean cut!",0
3/6/2017,0.5160544217687074,Positive,Wendy did a great job on my daughter's hair (age 10). We were walk-in customers and were helped right away. We were very pleased with Wendy's hair talent and the salon was very clean and welcoming. My daughter left with a great haircut that she was thrilled with.,0
8/24/2017,0.3766666666666667,Positive,"Love this place for a haircut. My son and I have been coming here for years and they have welcomed us like a family.

8/3/2017,0.3122727272727273,Positive,I had my hair cut by Melody. She is sweet and friendly and cut my hair really well. Love my new haircut.,0
12/29/2013,0.3880555555555556,Positive,Hands down the best salon I have been to EVER!The staff is wonderful and Lucy gives the best haircuts in the entire world!

9/25/2016,0.03666666666666665,Positive,"This is my first time going to Hair Days, as a walk-in. I have typical Asian hair, long and thick.  I was planning on getting a hair cut and coloring. I ended up getting Melody as my stylist. At first I was skeptical because she has broken English, but I realized that the majority of the stylists there, have broken English as well. But after the consultation, I began getting comfortable with her and ended up loving the results of my hair. I ended up paying a bit more than the their price list, because it really depends on the length of the hair. Which is understandable because I have longer hair, which needs more time than the average medium length. I would definitely go back to back to Melody for future haircuts and coloring.",0
11/15/2015,0.007905982905982913,Positive,"So I used to rave about Lucy, saying she is the only one that knows how to cut my hair. But not any more. Lately I've been noticing that when I leave the salon, I'm in a depressed mood. Not because my cuts were necessarily bad, but because of her life stories. For the past 3 times I've been there, I leave feeling like ""oh gosh, I can't believe that happened to her,"" or wondering if I left her a good enough tip to help her through this tough time she's going through. This third and final time, I'm thinking am I getting played? I know people go through all kinds of drama whether it be at home, work, love life whatever. But I NEVER bring it to my workplace, regardless of how bad I feel. And I feel like her stories have just brought me down. I leave feeling sorry for her and not at all excited about my cut. Like what?? It stuck out to me this last time. I understand you have issues and misfortunes, but we all have them. Now about my haircut, I showed a picture of what I wanted and I honestly felt as though she didn't want to cut it that way. I asked for her opinion because 1.  I trust her as she is my hairstylist and 2. I value her opinion.Not anymore. She didn't come close to the pic I wanted so now I'm left with a cut that's too short. My hair was grown out long and I was excited to come in to get the short ""in"" cut but she wasn't into it. Once again her personal life came into play I guess. I can't deal with the negativity and Debby downer attitude anymore resulting in a whatever haircut that was supposed to be a big step for me. Thanks a lot Lucy.",0
12/17/2016,0.45,Positive,Had an amazing hair cut done and the stylist got the exact color I wanted as well as cut my hair the way I asked which has been a struggle to find someone who would absolutely love this place.,0
11/9/2016,0.9,Positive,"Best hair cut place for me. Been coming here for over a year. Alan is the best. If you have WeChat, you can set up appointment time with him at ease. He also give you tips on your hair and what look good on you",0
9/27/2015,0.09969696969696967,Positive,"I started coming here after I moved to the area. I was looking for an inexpensive salon where I could still get stylish, short cuts. I saw some good reviews of this place and decided to give it a try.I went probably 2-3 times in the first half of 2014. On my first visit, there was some miscommunication when I made my initial appointment, so they didn't technically have me on the calendar, but they made room for me nevertheless. My stylist (Lucy) was fast and gave me a good cut, but when I mentioned that I was new to the area, she asked me if I was shopping around with other stylists (of course I was). She also asked me to tell her if I ever decided to consider a new stylist. I can understand why she'd want to know, but I've also never had a stylist ask for something like this, and I was a bit uncomfortable with the prying. Not that I wanted to admit this to a woman holding scissors over my head.Kidding aside, I went another time or two and got inexpensive cuts that were good but not great (and still more questions about whether I was seeing other hairdressers on the side). I was still on the fence, but on my last visit, Lucy cut my bangs too short (and without warning me beforehand). Now, I always bring pictures of the kinds of cuts I like--I wear pixie-short hair, but the reference photos I'd brought all showed longer bangs. After Lucy cut my bangs, I (cautiously) asked why she'd cut them so short, and she said something about cutting them short so they'd grow out the way I wanted. I didn't really buy it, and I decided to try a new hairdresser.",0
2/15/2016,0.5,Positive,"This place was weird. It has the nice salon feel to it but the quality of cut that I received was not so great. For the price, you can find better spots. Nice ladies but just not the best place for cuts.",0
11/22/2015,0.2163149500962001,Positive,"I've been going to this place for years and I still love it! Lucy has been an amazing stylist since day 1. I love the way she does my hair so much that I won't let anybody else touch it...and I live in San Francisco. That's right, you heard me. I live in SF and wait for much longer than I should because I don't want ANYONE else cutting my hair. I'm going to repeat that one more time to let it sink in. I travel over 400 MILES to get my haircut from Lucy!!! That's how much I love the work that she does!I have very thick hair that grows very fast and is difficult to maintain. I think the texturing that she does to it looks fantastic every time. This is tough because I have kind of a big head and past stylists haven't managed as well as she does. But, I have received numerous compliments on my haircuts from Hair Days.I always leave much happier than I was coming in. Lucy is a genuine person and is very easy to talk to. She always takes the time to ask about you and how you are doing. I feel very welcome whenever I set foot in Hair Days, like I'm family. Don't listen to any other reviewers that say otherwise, Lucy and the rest of the staff are second to none! I would highly recommend Hair Days to anyone who lives in Orange County, especially in Irvine. I can't tell you enough how awesome they are!!!",0

5/12/2014,0.15984610253478185,Positive,"Boy....being so new in town I knew I had to go through the arduous and frustrating task of finding a new hairdresser to cut my hair just the way I like it. I've had disaster experiences in the past and have feared trying out a new hairdressers ever since. This is when Yelp came in really useful. I just searched for the nearest hair salon that didn't look like only rich and snobby celebrities went to, and not those with screaming kids resisting the monthly visit to the hair choppers.I then narrowed it down to two salons not too far from me, and this place seem to have plenty of pretty good reviews. So, I called them up and made an appointment this afternoon....easy. Once I walked in, I was greeted by a little old lady already working on someone's hair....everybody else looked busy too, so I figured I'd have to wait. Then she asked me if I had an appointment, and I said yes, at 3pm. She asked who my hairdresser was, but I said this was my first time there. Then she yells out back.....""LUUUUSEEEEEE!......LUUUUUSSSEEEEEE!"" I thought I was in an old episode of I Love Lucy and looked around for Ricky ....JK :)I was then told to sit in at the station and to wait for Lucy. Then came a lady from the back room, that I assumed it was Lucy. I didn't know who I would get, but the reviews had a lot of good things to say about Lucy, so goody for me! She was very thorough and asked me exactly how I wanted my cut, and gave me numerous choices of lengths.....""down to the skin""...""somewhat covering the skin"".....or ""long."" I took the second one :) She then expertly started clipping my hair and trimming where needed. I felt bad as it was really hot outside and I was sweating a bit so hair was sticking to my neck.....she made the effort to go get a clean towel and wiped my neck clean. After the cut was over, I was ushered over to the hair wash station, which I wasn't expecting, and had a nice wash by another lady.I was very happy with the cut she gave me, and my fears were lifted as she advised me how to use the hair products.....that is, since I have the spiky textured hair look, I was advised to only use these products with dry to semi dry hair....not wet. Good to know.Note, I was a bit nervous when Lucy started on my hair as she seemed like the silent and moody type at first. But I broke the ice by chatting a bit about where I had traveled from, and we grew much more comfortable as we continued a friendly chat after that.Before coming here I had no idea what the cut and wash would cost. I guess it wasn't too bad. $25 cut and shampoo for men, and I gave a $5 tip.....maybe a bit much, but I didn't feel like asking Lucy to break a five. :)I have found my new regular hairdresser now :)",0
1/16/2017,0.5599999999999999,Positive,"Got me and my sister's haircut from BO and we were both very happy!! BO took time to understand the cut we need, and patiently cut our hair. Place was clean and appointment was easy to get. Overall we're both very happy!",0
2/19/2015,0.41039682539682537,Positive,"I was so so so lucky. THANK YOU LUCY!!I had been meaning to cut my hair for a while, and walked in on a Thursday evening (highly recommended by my boyfriend). Lucy gave me the most thorough consultation and asked so many great questions! After a wonderful wash, she carefully cut the layers, taking her time to pay attention to the details. She acknowledged each of my requests and explained each step to me (keep as much length as possible; cut off the dead ends; add some layers in). She made great suggestions about my hair partition, explaining the differences in shape that would result. After my cut was done, she styled my hair and gave me tips for other style ideas-- even demonstrating on her own hair for me!Aside from the great hair cut and styling service, Lucy was wonderfully personable. We talked about siblings, society, travel, significant others, her fashion-related experiences, childhoods, cultures... (And more)I later learned that I was extremely fortunate to have been able to have found her. She let me know that she travels a lot (and thus is not always here). If you want to laugh your head off from her down-to-earth comments and feel well taken care of, look for Lucy. (And, Lucy, if you're reading this, we ended up going to Chick-Fil-A to celebrate my hair because I was craving it! :))",0
3/30/2014,0.2833333333333333,Positive,My wife got a haircut from Melody a week ago. I liked it so much that I wanted my 3 year old daughter to get one from her as well. I've been holding out on her haircut because I was so worried about how it would turn out.Melody took her time and asked us how we would like this or that. She treated our daughter so well and we were quite astonished how our 3 year old sat in one place for the whole time :),0
5/2/2015,0.2654761904761905,Positive,"I came here to get my hair cut and styled. It's very close by me. I read the other reviews and most were good. There was a bad review about Wendy so I was very nervous that she would be the one to cut my hair. Well guess what...she was my stylist. She was great! She washed my hair and even gave a scalp massage that felt fantastic and relaxing.  She cut my hair to the exact length that I wanted.  She gave me some layers, and  long bangs. After drying my hair she thinned it out perfectly and without any pain (which has happened at other places). After some flat ironing and finishing oil I was looking great and loving my look. Only negative I had which wasn't a big deal was that the tip needed to be paid in cash. However  because it was my first time they let me add it to the bill. I will be going back and would be very happy having Wendy do my hair again.",0
1/16/2016,0.053744376538494176,Positive,"I came here spontaneously a few days before New Years Eve because it was the only place open in Irvine. I read a few reviews and had hoped to get Lucy prior to coming in, unfortunately she was not working that day but the receptionist assured me that someone there would be able to cut my thick hair.  My hair is really thick and coarse and in most cases every hairdressers worst nightmare. Before I got it cut here, it was completely fried after dying it 3 times over the span of 7 months. I was so sick of my long (waist length) hair and having to intensively heat style it to maintain a half decent look. I really wanted to chop of all of it and get one of the trendy ""lob"" haircuts I've been seeing a lot of lately. I pulled a few pictures from the internet, mainly of Rosie Huntington Whitley's long bob and headed to Hair Days. I arrived an hour before my appointment and was promptly greeted by an older Korean woman. Her name was MELODY. I explained to her what I wanted and showed her the pictures of Rosie Huntington Whitley and she seemed receptive to what I asked even though there was a slight bit of a language barrier to overcome. I also wanted to do something a bit different to reduce the thickness of my hair and get a ""nape undercut,"" basically shaving the back of my head. But because my hair is so thick and I would wear it down all the time if its cut short, no one would notice. After taking the time to ask how I wanted my hair cut, she proceeded to cut my hair.I was wearing my hair in a ponytail and in no time at all  she pulled out scissors and cut the bulk of the ponytail off. I didn't even have time to feel sentimental about it. She washed my hair and then proceeded to spend 1.5 hours cutting  it and then styling it. I got in at 4 and left at 6. I have never spent that long getting my hair cut. Melody did burn my scalp with the blow dryer but I know it wasn't intentional and my hair was pin straightened beautifully in the end. I paid $45 for my cut but gave her $20 tip because I absolutely adore my haircut. I've been to supercuts where it is $14.99 to cut my hair and places where it costs nearly $70 to cut my hair all in the hopes that I would find the right place. I think I finally have, and I would say it's in the middle tier category as far as price not to steep but not cheap either. The amount of time and energy Melody spent on my hair and making sure I got the right haircut in my eyes is worth more than $45. I didn't want to write this review preemptively so I have waited around 3 weeks to really adjust to my haircut and see if I like it. But my hair is so much lighter and healthier and I adore it. She didn't give me the exact cut I had wanted, like Rosie Huntington Whitley whose longest layer was shoulder lengths. Most of my layers are slightly past my collar bones. I have never once liked a ""medium length"" hairstyle on me or willingly got it cut this short without a hairstylist choosing to lop it all off for me but I absolutely adore what Melody did. She heard what I wanted, but didn't give me 100% exactly what I wanted rather something that works better with my hair type,face shape, etc.  Now I have a soft undercut and mid length hair and I am in love with it. I have coarse, thick, Indian hair and Melody took about 10 inches of it off but I absolutely love it. Don't hesitate to see her if you have hair like mine. This may be the first salon I go back to.",0
10/31/2016,0.2577432216905901,Positive,"I have been going to Hair Days for over 5 years now because I love Lucy! Yes, like the show, she cracks me up and I always have such a good time chatting with her as she washes and then cuts my hair.  I was first referred to Lucy by a friend who's haircut I was admiring.  I used to drive to Asiaville to save money on my hair cuts but it was always hit or miss.  I then found a stylist at a salon but she didn't really know how to cut asian hair and the prices weren't as affordable.  The prices at Hair Days are reasonable and I usually am able to get an appointment on short notice.  Lucy is very talented at what she does and having asian hair you need someone who is familiar with it to cut it properly.  The salon is modern and clean and I have spent many hours there getting my hair cut, doing a deep moisturizing treatment and having my hair colored. Someone always greets you when you step in the door and they always offer you a beverage of some sort.  If you're looking for a new hairstylist check out Hair Days Salon!",0

Another 20 minutes go by and my Mom being the nice woman doesn't complain and just told the woman she had to go and had the nerve to say if yoyou come back in 15 minutes we can do your hair.  Did this woman just ignore the fact my mom had an appointment or not understand what having an appointment meant? I was perturbed hearing about this because my Mom who like me has very little time for herself was so excited about trying this place.   Some businesses work like government agencies where they just don't get it.  Service is everything and brings customers back, especially first impressions.  I was even thinking of going to this place but likely won't now.  So you lose a customer and a potential one.I just wish I knew the name of the two women that were working that day.",0
7/27/2014,0.2782275132275132,Positive,"Went in today to get my haircut after reading reviews about Hair days salon. When I arrived it was a very clean and well organized barber shop with quick service (I had no appt.) I assumed that the service provided would be very nice considering all of that. The lady that cut my hair named Wendy was advised before hand that I want a trim but if I did not like how it looked I would be buzzing it (I figured I should give her a heads up that it may take longer than an average haircut). So it began she was doing a great job don't get me wrong, and the trim would have looked great to many people maybe, but I personally did not like it so much. After a bit of contemplation the barber (Wendy) says to me, ""just be honest with me do you like it yes or no?"" I did not think much of it but after I said, ""well I do, but maybe can we try to trim it down a bit more. I am in no rush"". Her response to my statement dramatically changed my view on this store as she muttered to herself, ""it's my time too!"" After hearing that statement I told her to not even worry about it and just buzz my hair to make it short and simple so I did not waste anymore of her time. After finishing I walked to the front desk where I was greeted by an elderly woman who I gave my card to. Swiped my card and all went well, as I was signing the receipt I asked where to put the tip amount. The woman's response was, ""read the sign"" which said something along the lines of, ""no purchases under $20 with card, gratuity will be added to your bill"". I did not plan to leave a tip. Nor do I plan to return. Customer service needs to be worked on, you shouldn't treat a customer like you are doing them the favor. The two stars provided are for the cleanliness which is probably not worthy of 2 stars. In short if you are like me and just want somewhere with good service polite people and fair prices, take your business elsewhere.",0

The girl was free!  Free from that boring look.  Free from having to wash that never-ending flux of hair.  Free from the monotony of the long hair-do.  She came back to school, and there were gasps and ""ooo""s and ""ahhh""s.  Yes.  (Cue dramatic sound).  And the man of her dreams saw her.  Really saw her.  And he said to himself, ""She's more interesting than I gave her credit for.""  From then on, that little Chinese girl never grew out her hair longer than shoulder-length.  She rocks a short pixie cut to this day, changing it up at her own whim, free as a bird.  She married the man of her dreams, who's attention was first captured by her bold move to get her hair cut off by Lucy.  Eight years and going strong.  Yes.  Dreams can come true.  (Fade to sunset).So get your hair cut at Hair Days Beauty Salon.  Lucy will take good care of you.  And, who knows?  Maybe it will be a life-changing cut.",0

I then asked her if instead of highlights can she cut my hair and she told me no, that I should not cut my hair and I should go put ""sun in"" in my hair.

I looked on YELP, and found this place really close to where I live, with pretty good reviews. So I made an appointment. The lady that cut my hair, Wendi, did not smile or talk the whole 1 hour and 30 minutes. Except for the times I was telling her that my hair was looking really bad, and she needed to fix it. Then she would tell me ""that's what the haircut it supposed to be like"". I asked countless time to fix REALLY BAD LOOKING areas of my hair that she had created, she only made it so much worse. I think that I would have done a much better job cutting my own hair. She also made it too short, so now I have to come up with new ways to make my hair look ok, until it grows a little and I can go to a real hairdresser and have it fixed. If you care about the way your hair looks, DO NOT EVER LET THAT WOMAN TOUCH YOUR HAIR!!!Oh and when I told the lady that seemed to be in charge of the place how unhappy I was with my hair (I was polite and kept a normal voice tone the whole time), she said that it's my fault, because I did not tell her what I want...Conclusion: IF you decide to go there STAY AWAY FROM WENDY! She is the most untalented hairdresser I've ever known! I gave the place 2 stars because it was clean, and pretty decent looking, and all the staff had good looking hair.

5/9/2014,0.19250000000000003,Positive,"I have to say in my 25 years of life, I have never found a more fitting salon for my haircuts. While Supercuts does their pricing relatively cheap, this place (for men)  will run you around 30-35 bucks, including tip. But the quality is what your paying for,  and let me tell you this : this place knows how to cut your hair, before you even tell them. The place itself is very neat and organized, and gives of a professional feel. Same goes for the hair stylists, but once you've been work them a couple of times, they become more endearing, and even friends. I've been cutting my hair here for almost 5 years now, and the place has disappointed me. Never. Do you know how difficult that is to say about something as uncertain as a haircut? So for women, the pricing is of course more expensive, but again, quality is what you're paying for. Most of the reviews here praise Lucy,  a popular stylist amongst men, but in my honest opinion,  they all do very solid quality work. Lucy is also a favorite of mine though,  even if she tells me I'm not supposed to favor her.  She's always so modest.  Anyways, if you're looking for a good place for a haircut; this would be the place to start.",0

When I sat down, the hair dresser recommended I get a Japanese hair straightening treatment so I said ok. DONT DO IT. Mid process, the very unprofessional clerk, for whatever reason, didn't allow the hair dresser to put the neutralizer in my hair (which stops the straightening process so that the hair doesn't get further damaged). So by the time I left the place, my hair was literally falling out, it was so dry. It was both breaking off and literally falling out when I ran my fingers through it. I lost about a half a head of hair. Scariest experience. I was quite literally crying. For you girls with short hair or long hair even, heck!, you know how scary it is to lose hair. I kid you not I got bald spots. I should have reported this place. I immediately went to my usual hair dresser, I was frantic, fold her it was an emergency and she could see why when she finally saw my hair. I had her add the neutralizer or try to undo whatever the hair dresser at hair days did to me. She did the best she could. I still left with bald spots but at least the hair didn't continue to fall out. It was ridiculous. This place is below par. Never let an untrained clerk tell the actual hair dresser what to do. My mistake for being polite and not doing something about it.

I explained. my concerns, and what I wanted, and showed a picture of the style I wanted. And he did an amazing job. He is A Master with his scissors. He not only takes his time to listen to your needs, he also takes the time to cut your hair. To him, haircut is not just clipping you hair and send you out of the door. Haircut is an art to him, therefore he takes the time to do his work. He continues to take classes, sometimes abroad, to improve his skills and I was really impressed and happy with his work. When I came home with the haircut, my daughters said "" mom, this is one of the best haircut you ever had. It really looks good! "". Later my daughters started going to him, and then my son and shortly after that, my husband. So now, my entire family of 5 goes to him for our hair cuts.

She is really creative and cares for all the aspects of your hair. Another point i appreciated is that the cuts would always grow out well. Even if you didn't get your hair cut for 6 months, the shape would still look great. She is a hairstylist that can practically recreate any cut that you show her a picture of and then recreate it in a fitting way for your face and hair texture so that it will still work out well. One point I would say is that you should try to avoid evening hours because they get really busy. She works well under pressure, but I liked to give her ample time to play around with my hair.",0

He is AWESOME!I'm growing my hair out from a pixie type cut to an asymmetrical bob and I'm sure everyone is aware of the precarious in-between stages - having a stylist who can work with you so you still look good while navigating such rocky terrain is priceless. I came in with several pictures (different angles of the same cut) of what I wanted, put my trust in Bo and was NOT disappointed.First off, wonderful massage when he washed my hair. Next, he sat me down in his chair and carefully studied the pics that I provided. He asked lots of questions, played with my hair for a moment to get an idea of weight and texture, and then started in.As my cut took shape (he was actually somewhat tweaking a cut I'd gotten a few weeks earlier that I wasn't all that satisfied with as well), he took his time, stopped frequently to ask if he was headed in the right direction and referred often to the pictures. He blow-dried to see how it looked, re-wetted to work further, blew out again, etc. He had me check the back 5 times and each time, when there was one teensy little thing I wanted changed, he took care of it with a smile.He was very personable, patient and professional and I walked out of Hair Days with one of the best cuts I've had in, literally, 10 years! When I went to pay and was told that tips could not be given via credit card payment (I had zero cash), I felt terrible. It was close to closing time when I was done but I asked if I could run into Albertsons to quickly get some cash (I felt Bo deserved a HUGE tip), Bo told me not to worry about it that my tip to him would be to come back again. SUCH a nice guy! (You can bet he'll get a big, fat tip when he cuts my hair this Wednesday.)I've been raving about my cut and loving my hair (I've had no bad hair days since May!) every day. It's been about 10 weeks since my first cut with Bo and it has grown out fabulously. Truth be told, I could probably go another few weeks because it's still holding the look I want but I'm getting anxious for a trim.I won't be going to anyone else from now on, Bo's my guy! The rest of the staff is very nice as well, I received great service overall.

It is quite a steal at $40 or less for the quality of service.I've even convinced my brother to come here who has gotten a haircut by Stella a couple of times. He loves it as well.,0

I like it, but I don't love it. I gave it 3 stars because every time that I've made an appointment, I end up waiting longer than walk-ins. What's the point of making an appointment if they're not going to adhere to it. Might as well just be a walk-in since I'll probably get my hair cut sooner.",0

I decided to make time and write this one because of the amazing service, consultation, and hair cut I received at Hair Days.      My hair is very fine, wavy, and is receding at the top of my head. Lucy's quick eye to my hair dilema and skillful use of the scissors, resulted in a hair cut that was nothing short of spectacular.     Unlike any other hairdressers I have had, Lucy openly shares with you techniques to keeping your hair looking the best. For example, how to position the brush while youre blowdrying your hair or the best products to use.      Lucy was also easy to talk with. She clearly explains what she will do before she cuts your hair to ensure that she is on the same page with you. The resulting cut she did exceeded my expectations.      Great cut, professional service, and genuine care are some reasons why i will definitely have all my future ""hair days"" with Lucy.",0

8/15/2011,0.1894766368283317,Positive,"Called early in the day to ask if they're able to accommodate a same-day appointment. I tried to get Lucy, since everyone here seems to recommend her, but she was on vacation, so I settled with Melody (the lady who answered the phone).Came in fifteen minutes early. First impression: the salon is spacious and clean. Good sign. Melody greeted me. At the time, she was still finishing up with a client so she asked me to sit down; I perused through two binders full of hairstyles while I waited. So here's my situation: A-line bob for the past year and a half, currently growing it out for my marriage next year...and it's not growing out pretty. So when I sat down, I explained to Melody what was going on and asked her for advice--which she did without being too pushy about her opinions. Since my hair hadn't grown out long enough, she suggested doing a simple trim in the back, adding more layers, shortening the front, and giving me side-swept bangs. I said, ok.Shampoo was good. She made small talk as she washed my hair (occasionally letting me know that she does bridal hair as well...). Massage wasn't too harsh or anything...and honestly, I don't really care much for head massages while they wash my hair--i just want my hair washed!Haircut took about 40 minutes. She really puts that cloak on you, fyi. I thought for a while I was going to suffocate because the darn thing was so tight! But i quickly forgot about it. Our small talk consisted of her getting to know me (read: being nosy about my upcoming marriage?) and me getting to know her (she's Indonesian, been doing hair for 22 years, took classes at Vidal Sassoon in London, etc). End result was awesome. Her styling was simple but looked really good. She asked if I would be able to recreate it and i said, ""no"" and she said: ""oh no! I'm going to have to school you!"" She then proceeded to walk me through, step by step, on how to do a simple blowout and to make sure my bangs stayed in place. PLUS, it only cost me $40 plus tip for my haircut! (note: pricing is based on hair length...so short hair is $35 and longer hair $45-$50). Best part was, when I walked out, no annoying pieces of hair all over my face or clothes or in my bra (I was wearing a v-neck shirt). So i guess almost choking me to death with that cloak was worth it because I pretty much wanted to just stay out and show off my new hair (but didn't because I'm such a homebody that I just went back home, admired my hair for a while, then played video games...sigh)Overall, I had a good experience. The place was pretty busy for a Monday, so definitely make an appointment (Melody was booked the whole day until 8 pm...she's got a good clientele!).Quick tip: they do kids' hair too...a mom came in with her son and he came out of the salon looking adorable! Also, it's not a big hassle or anything, but they do prefer you pay in cash (they have a little swiper thing for the card, but it's a hassle for Melody because she's always busy and for some reason, none of the other stylists know how to use the stupid thing). so yeah, some useful info in case you were wondering.Yup, found my Irvine stylist...so happy!",0

I had shown Lucy a picture of what I wanted (Beyonce's long wavy hair with long bangs) and she was able to recreate that look for me and even curled my hair so that I would get the full effect (I have super straight hair). At first I was nervous and kept quiet while Lucy washed my hair but after a few light chit chats I felt very comfortable with Lucy that by the time I left the salon I couldn't stop yapping. :) Despite Lucy's young age, she is very talented and definitely knows how to cut hair. I have long hair and my cut, including wash and style was $40 which is about the same price as other ""okay"" salons in Rowland Heights. For sure I will now go back to Hair Days/Lucy for my hair cuts. It's definitely worth the drive!Appointment is advised since she's one very busy lady. FYI, Lucy is off every Wednesdays.",0

I don't think he had ever cut hair before and proceeded to chop my hair into BIG layers in random places....I was in shock as to what happened....

I am probably the pickiest person on the planet, so this is saying a lot. I originally ended up at Hair Days because I had heard so many wonderful things about Lucy. Of course, I had to give her a try. I still remember all the questions she asked me regarding my hair, my style, what I liked, disliked,...She also had such great input and advice as far as what she thought would look good on me and WHY. This was exactly what I was looking for in a stylist. Too many stylists ask questions but give no input. On the flipside, other stylists don't ask any questions and basically take control, assuming the client will be happy with the end result. In the end, Lucy delivered, which is why I continue to go back to her. Lucy isn't all talk. If she suggests something about style, that's what you'll end up with. You won't leave feeling like you got something you didn't expect. I always leave with exactly what I was looking for.  Now, no one touches my hair except Lucy.",0

From beginning to end the experience of the haircut was not just a procedure, but rather a dynamic of someone who actually cares about what you want and will do their best to make you happy before you walk out the door! Scott is multilingual in some languages too, and he was nice in the beginning to make it comfortable to chit chat. *Also, my first haircut, he ended up giving me a suggestion on what he felt would match my preference: an edgy, subtle, sexy style for a to-be corporate businessman. I never even seen this style before, and once I walked out from then until now.... I got so many double takes from strangers and at work. Some even asked me where to get it!  He spent a longer time than usual cutting my hair, but that was because he was not willing to let me out the door until it is PERFECT! and EVEN! Not one single strand left astray.  That is what I want. I'm sure that is what you want too, best bang for the buck. After he cut my hair and washed it (twice!), I was about to get up from my seat to pay, but he said.... ""slow down there, I ain't letting you walk out ...until you're fresh and good""......and he proceeded to blow dry my hair, and gel/wax it up!

7/5/2011,0.22346380471380473,Positive,"I have been getting my haircut by Melody consistently for over two years now and finally decided that I should write a review.I have been to many different places to get my haircut in the past and have never had a hairstylist as good as Melody cut my hair.  Melody is friendly, courteous, and always willing to fit you into her schedule.   She is able to work my hair into some spikey magic that looks great every time, always receives compliments, and makes the women want to run their hands through it like in the Axe commercials.I'll usually get my hair cut short, thinned, with a scissor only cut style all around.  What is good about the cut is that even over the time, as it grows out, it remains a good looking haircut.  This is a sign that the person who gave the haircut knew what they were doing and is talented in the arts.  I have thick hair, so for thinning my hair, Melody uses a style of taking the scissors open face and moving along a section of hair.  I like this type of cut, as opposed to using alligator scissors, as it provides a more natural look and looks better as it grows out.The good thing about Hair Days is that your hair is washed prior to the haircut and after the haircut.  I have been used to going to different places to get my haircut in the past that only cut your hair and leave the cut hairs on you which make it hard to go back immediately to work after a haircut.If you are looking for a new hairstylist or want to make sure your hair will be cut properly every time by a professional, go see Melody at Hair Days.  If you want your hair cut like your mom put a bowl on your head and gave you a 90's step cut, then go to Other Cuts.",0

She's an experienced stylist who knows what style accompanies my face shape, and she's definitely a sweetheart with edge. Super clean and totally worth it! I actually live in Boulder, CO now and whenever I fly home to LA... I make sure to get my hair cut with her EVERY TIME.",0

I used to drive all the way to Los Feliz to get my hair permed, since it's soooo hard to find a stylist knows how to work with my super straight hair. Bo took time to understand my hair, my habits and what hair styles will still make me feel natural with my new perms. He's very careful & gentle with handling my hair, he makes sure every step is done right with ultimate level of precision! My whole experience is so relaxing & smooth, I felt like I have finally found ""home"" for my hair!!:)",0

I just had the best hair cut today at Hair Days.  Jerry was awesome; very patient and good at what he does.  The price is very reasonable.  For $45, I got shampoo, cut, and blow dry.   He gave me suggestions and my haircut turns out great.  Love it!  Will definitely go back again.  Thank you, thank you!!!",0

6/21/2011,0.15972027972027975,Positive,"I went here based on the reviews and It was pretty much what I expected.  I made  an appointment with Lucy since she was so highly recommended.  She was very nice and paid close attention to cutting my hair.  Also, she dims a nice head massage when wash my hair.  The hair cut I got was pretty good, especially for the 20$ price tag.  I don't live in Irvine and I won't be traveling to come back, but in a pinch, at least you know your hair won't be but butchered.",0
7/31/2013,0.31507936507936507,Positive,My friend had recommended Lucy at Hair Days! I am so glad I went. I had a great experience. Lucy was my stylist. I got a fantastic hair cut and all over color job from her. She listened to what I wanted and provided amazing feed back on what type of cut and color was right for my lifestyle and face shape. She is very knowledgeable. She also was so helpful with maintenance tips!  Will definitely coming back to Lucy and Hair Days!,0
2/13/2013,0.25500000000000006,Positive,"Luci at Hairdays is amazing. She has been cutting my hair since 2005 and always does an amazing job. She always takes great care and never cuts corners such as primarily using an electric razor like you'll get at the cheapo haircut places. I moved out of state for a couple years and would always make it a point to get my haircut when back in SoCal visiting. If you're a guy looking for a great haircut, look no further. So long as I'm in Orange County I will always go to Luci for my hair.",0
10/13/2012,0.333625,Positive,"A great upscale looking salon at very affordable prices. I've been going there, to Lucy,  for 6 years and use to go to very upscale Beverly Hills salons. It is such a find!! I have very thick, medium length hair and always get compliments on the final results. Whether it is flat ironed or curled, it lasts me a long time and looks like I just came out of Cristophes or Louis Licari at an 1/8 of the cost but just as good.. She takes a lot of time and care in making it perfect every time! The appointments are easy to get, most of the time. The salon is always clean, great music, and very friendly stylists. I think you would be fine with any stylist as this is no Super Cuts or Fantastic Sams. Time to treat yourself with very affordable rates and experienced stylists.",0
4/30/2009,0.24349206349206348,Positive,"Male review: I found this place because my friend goes here. Always went to a cheapo ($10) Vietnamese place in Santa Ana and never left the salon happy. Finally decided that I could shell out some money for a haircut I wanted. Get to Hair Days and it's really clean. Ended up getting Lisie. She's fairly young and a sweetheart. Her Indonesian accent is kind of prominent but nothing that we don't handle on a daily basis. She knows what she's doing and it was so refreshing to finally get a stylist who took the time to do things right [I guess you do get what you pay for :)] And I ended up only paying $20! (for men) I will definitely go back. If you decide to go, ask for Lisie and tell her Alex says hi!",0
3/23/2011,0.15224358974358976,Positive,"I've been going to this salon for over 3 years and I've always been happy with the results.  Sometimes I make the mistake of choosing a photograph of a haircut that I think will work with my hair type but it doesn't quite make the grade.  My stylist Lucy offers her advice as to whether my choices will work with my hair or not.  Of course I appreciate this frankness as it's always nice to avoid a -- disASSter haircut.  I'm a little surprised by some unflattering reviews here but people by nature are born critics.  Also, I know from experience some people have very unrealistic expectations in regards to what their money will buy.  These are the people that want the huge Sony TV but only at a price lower than a Sanyo.  This is a mid-level salon my friends.  You shouldn't confuse it with the ""haircut factory"" chain stores and similarly you won't think you're at Jose Eber on Rodeo either.  As long as you're a ""grounded individual"" and you walk in with these realistic expectations you should have a really good experience at Hair Days.",0
6/20/2008,0.31759259259259265,Positive,I am so happy to have found this place. I went here just because it's on my way home and I needed a haircut BAD. I got Lucy (she's awesome!) and she did a GREAT job on my hair. I paid around 50 (I think..) and I have fairly long hair. The price is great compared to what I have been paying for less than stellar results. Oh and that conditioner stuff she put in my hair made it so soft for days!,0
2/16/2011,0.7208333333333333,Positive,"I've been a faithful customer of Hair Days for almost 5 years.  I can say without a doubt that this is the BEST VALUE and the HIGHEST QUALITY haircut you can get.  The stylists at Hair Days are very experienced and are high-end salon caliber without the high-end price.  If you're reading this review, I would guess that you really care about getting a great cut - this is the place for you.  I've since moved out of Irvine and still ride my scooter 15 miles to see my favorite hair cutters!  Yes, they're that good.",0
10/25/2012,0.13922371031746025,Positive,"I'm very selective about my hair and in the past have been willing to travel far and go to more expensive stylists to get the right cut.  However, for the past year, I been lucky enough to come across Lucy at Hair Days.  As far as men's haircuts, she has been one of the most intuitive, helpful, and skilled stylists I've had cut my hair.  And the clincher is that my haircut is also reasonably priced.  The salon is no frills, nice, clean, with an easy going atmosphere.  Staff is very friendly.  However, the reason I continue to go back time and time again over the past year is that Lucy is great at cutting hair.  Add to that, she has an extensive background in fashion and hair.  Works with very high-end clientele all over (east coast, europe).  To me, very hard to find someone like that in Irvine of all places.  Despite being very skilled, she is super down to earth and works with me so that I get the cut I want every time.  Very prompt and professional as well.  In the infrequent event that she is running late which is an inevitable occurence at hair places, I feel that I'm still taken care of and my business and time are valued.",0
