Was able to get seated in no time at all and my barber, Lindsey, was very polite, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable. My beard was perfectly tame in no time at all and I walked out of there with a smile. 10/10 will return there without hesitation.",0
1/30/2018,0.1976719576719577,Positive,"TL;DR - Good for hair and straight shave, bad for beards. Good atmosphere and management cares.I travel a lot for work and was unable to get my beard trimmed and hair done by my barber in Seattle before coming to Irvine. I researched beforehand barbers around the area who offered straight-blade (I love a straight shave around the beard and neck) and landed on Roosters. I chose to schedule an appointment because of their close proximity to my hotel, their ratings on Yelp, and their photos. It seemed like a legit place. I pulled up and parked next to a Rolls Royce Phantom, so I thought to myself, man this'll be great if a Rolls is in the area...and sure enough it was very welcoming. They offered coffee, water, or even beer which was unexpected. Sat down and had a great conversation with the barber about what I'd like done with my beard and hair. The hair went smooth and had good conversation during. I was extremely unhappy with the beard trim. It was really bad, not at all what we discussed, crooked, and choppy. I'd recommend anyone who truly cares about their beards to go elsewhere or ask for their best beard barber. I brought this up after I left and the management made it right. I was willing to pay for the hair cut and shave, but not the beard trim but they insisted they refund in full and offered an opportunity for me to come back free of charge. Without that redeeming offer from Roosters this would have been a much lower score.",0

I came in with my wife and my son and right away they greeted us with friendly vibes and offered us something to drink, and the best thing was that they had a stack of kids books for my son to read while he waited for me to get my hair cut.

To start, it's easy to make an appointment to fit your schedule. You have an overview of the schedule on Yelp and you can see which barbers are working each day. According to previous Yelp reviews, I decided to have my son see Lindsey and I'm so glad we did! I'm very particular with how my son's hair is cut, ensuring it's not too short or uneven and Lindsey was awesome!! She asked me what I'd like and knew what to do. Not only did she take her time and paid attention to detail, but she has a great personality as well. She is a true professional and my son and I love the great haircut she gave. Regarding the shop, it is very clean and well kept and the design and decor evoke old time barber shops which I appreciate. Thank you Lindsey for your time and we'll be back!",0

8/12/2017,0.12396825396825399,Positive,"I got a bad hair cut for $40 bucks. I basically paid double for a Supercuts quality haircut while listening to my stylist tell me how she cheated on her boyfriend the night before. I walked in and was taking right back. She asked how I wanted my hair and I said a zero fade to finger tips on top. She gets the work done fairly quickly. Except there is no zero fade. It is a one, which isn't a huge difference, but that it stretches my cut an extra week if I am lucky (and at the price I paid it needs to stretch as far as possible). The fade is not horrible, it just is not short enough. The top is fine, but again it looks off with the bad fade since it does not blend into the top properly. As my stylist is wrapping up with my hair (post wash, asking me about product as she is going through her cabinet to decide what to put in it), I feel the back of it and realize, SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH MY NECK LINE! It's just as long as it was when I walked in 45 min ago. I turn around since she hasn't yet (and never did show me the back), and ask her to razor edge my hair (as described in their menu for their basic hair cut) and she was said ""oh! Sure,"" like she was surprised that I need the back and neck line of my hair cleaned up too. Tf?TL;DR: I coulda gone to a regular (also iPhone autocorrected that to real, coincidence?) barber shop, paid ten bucks and tip and got a better hair cut in under 30 min. Go some place else.",0

Not only is the haircut done professionally and to my exact request every time but the barbers' work with me and help me figure out what would be best for me personally.

12/17/2017,0.2990633608815427,Positive,Completely satisfied with the level of service and haircut I received from Brandon and Roosters. Super nice guy that really knew what to do with my difficult frizzy curly hair. I have gone to many places over the years and can say this is my new favorite spot.

9/30/2016,0.17720238095238097,Positive,"Very disappointing experience for my first time there. I call in and ask for a neck and beard line up with a straight razor and beard trim. I asked the guy how much it was, he said $17. Awesome. I get there and the barber was very nice but told the guy at the front he put the wrong code in the system. Okay cool. Shave takes place, good experience as far as the relaxation part goes. Esthetically I would of done a better job shaving my face and neck with a Gillette razor. Half my neck was not even done. I have to go home and shave the rest. It was also uneven on the top and bottom. Overall I felt they didn't set the right expectations, they ended up charging me $40 instead of $17 like I was quoted on the phone. Then when I asked about the big price difference the guy basically blamed it on me and stated he quoted both prices to me on the phone. I only heard one number for a neck shave and beard trim - $17. Not cool guys.",0

12/3/2017,0.0076298701298701255,Positive,"Bad experience. My former stylist left Roosters.  I very deliberately sought a new recommendation and made an appointment well in advance.  They called to confirm the appointment the day before and stressed the need for me to be on time.  I arrived on time and they told me that someone else would be working with me.  My recommended stylist had called in ill.  That can happen.  I understand.  However, they should have called me.  I wasted on hour of my time, driving to and from the aborted appointment.  The manager just assigned someone to me.  I can do that  at any number of lower cost outlets.  The manager should have called me in advance to discuss options.  I was told that the stylist had called in sick 30 minutes earlier, which was before I left home.  She also could have offered me a ""make good"" for her error.  She did not.  I left without an option to reschedule (I need the haircut within the next two days for an event) or any offer to make it up to me in some way.  I've lost confidence in Roosters.  I expected more, given the premium price that they charge. Their stylists may be great, but management seems presumptive, disorganized and uncaring.",0

I asked how that is possible since he had a block of time set for my husband's appointment and 5 minutes wouldn't have made a difference. I could understand 2t or even 10. When my husband and I left he went back in to get the name of the person who basically blew us off, and this woman was extremely rude. She let us know that this place is a franchise so ""complain all you want"". Basically they don't care about the customer and want nothing to do with trying to make the situation better.

8/27/2016,0.07978100331041509,Positive,"Today we learned that Roosters has some unwritten age limit beyond which they don't encourage customers to come in, perhaps they should post that age limit in their window so that it's clear.My elderly father has gone to a traditional barber his entire life and now that he has moved from his home to an assisted living facility half a mile away from Roosters, we were delighted to find a business so close to where he lives and with handicapped parking right out front, it seemed like an ideal solution.I cannot describe how completely disappointed and discouraged I am to see that they are not interested in providing services to elderly men who live in assisted living.  My father is a veteran and has served others his entire life, but Roosters apparently prefers a younger, hipper clientele.God willing, we will all grow old one day.  Roosters offers their ""popular Roosters Club Cut at a special price for all active duty military, police, fire and EMS.""  But apparently the retired and the elderly need not apply.Growing old is hard, it rips my heart out to see what my parents are going through, and now the local barber climbs on board to marginalize a man whose only crime is living a long life.  I hope someone working at Roosters thinks of this when faced with caring for their own loved one in later years, perhaps at some point they will realize how hurtful and disrespectful it is to the elderly and  those who love them.  By the way, his hair and beard are still growing just like they always have.Thank God Tustin Barbers, who have been cutting my dad's hair for years, treat him with the respect and dignity he deserves.  We were hoping for the option of a location nearer to where he lives now, but what we learned today is that some things are worth driving for, and you can't put a price on respect and common courtesy. Just so sad about this.",0

9/28/2017,0.2154385964912281,Positive,"I took my son here today. He has cerebral palsy. Jesus was the one who cut his hair. Hmm. Jesus was not as experienced as I would have expected. My son stayed as still as he could have. I did explain to Jesus that if he moved or leaned, he would correct himself by either tapping him or telling him. My son's neck isn't strong, so if the barber moved him with his machine, my son would move. Either this guy Jesus, is too high on his horse or he doesn't have the experience he should, but would say if my son moved again he would not finish. I told him I didn't understand the issue bc It has never been a problem. He continued, but seemed frustrated. He's probably just used to working with mannequins. Originally I told him I wanted skin taper. He thought I didn't understand what that was. I let him cut it to the length of his (Jesus') comfort level. When he was done I asked what the difference was between what I wanted and what he did. 0.5. I said yes, that's what my son always gets. He said he would not have been able to do that for him. I went here bc it was closer to my house, but I will b going to where i normally go, a place that is much more welcoming, and way more experienced with all ages! Men only, too. They charge the same and they've also been on TV. Same services offered. American Barbershop in Santa Ana. Extremely professional, friendly and nobody is on a horse here. Tip is earned and optional, Jesus did not get a tip. Too bad, I'm a good tipper.",0

Men are typically utilitarian creatures and don't need any of this schmancy frou-frou business. They just want a good haircut.EDIT: I've added an extra star to reflect owner John's efforts to learn from and resolve this experience.Loathe to say it, but perhaps a man would have done a better job?- Noticeably crooked shape at nape of the neck.- Thick around the ears.- Asked for scissor cut, whereby she later went over the whole head with a razor anyway. What's the point?- As a result of the above, the final look had dry ends and appeared very frizzy.- Concerning the shave, missed a very noticeable section on one cheek.- A few random hairs around the chin.- Mustache poorly shaped, and lines not clean.Couldn't even take pictures because he didn't want to be documented.I suggest you look elsewhere.",1

She started to do her own thing with the scissors and I caught her as she started to thin my hair without even asking me...Will not return, going to wait until this hair grows back and then find somebody new.

She didn't even ask if I wanted product or what kind, and just went straight for the gel and gooped it all over my head like cement. Absolutely horrible job. Worst haircut I've ever had.

She couldn't have heard/listened to a word I said because she pulled out a trimmer right then and shaved 3 inches off my beard. Not only am I still trying to figure out what the shape (style) is she shaved onto my face (I've never seen a beard look like this, it's awful), but I spent over two months filling out my beard to have it tidied at that length, and she removed nearly all of the beard length.

12/11/2012,0.3164367816091953,Positive,"Great haircut, nice place.This is one of those upscale men's barber places where they do a few extra ""fancy"" things for the higher price you pay. The interior is very clean and designed with a lot of wood (including the barber chairs) to generate a feeling of an old-school barber shop. The stylist took her time and made sure the details were taken care of so that my hair looked excellent upon completion. She also shaved the back of my neck. After hot towels were placed on my face, my hair was gently washed with great smelling shampoo & conditioner. Add a brief scalp massage and I was feeling quite relaxed when I walked out of there.I admit that I normally go to a cheap haircut place and am happy with the woman who cuts my hair but she was on vacation so I came here (I want to be clear that I wasn't cheating on her). At triple the price I normally pay, I got a superb cut at Roosters as well as a bottle of water after checking in plus the aforementioned scalp massage, etc. For some men the extra attention and perks are worth it; if you are a guy who budgets a lot for grooming and are picky about your hair, I would recommend this as the perfect place to come. For a balding old guy like me, it's a treat to come here but I don't want to spend that much each time I need a simple haircut.Note: After this first fairly good experience I came once more, getting the worst haircut of my life. Quality will depend on who you get!",0

It isn't a place where you walk in and they ask you what number you want. This is a professional salon. Make sure you ask for Alisa Soohoo. She's new to this salon but she's been cutting my hair for many years. I'm probably the most picky of most men you'll meet for who cuts my hair. I have very thick hair so most people who cut my hair go crazy. Alisa always knows how to cut my hair. She used to be located closer to me. She is totally worth the extra 15 minute drive to get my hair cut. Reminder ask for Alisa Soohoo In best regards, Jeremy Myers",0

Mind you I used to beg my bf to go here every time because of the price but I had confidence it was worth it but then...it wasn't.. Just like everybody else, we have busy lives and getting a haircut just isn't that high on our priority list. However, when we do we want it done well. Yet during one of my bf's visits, the entire staff - yes including the person sweeping the hair off the floor who has nothing to do with cutting my bf's hair- told him to come in for a cut more frequently multiple times like yes, we get it but so what? If they don't want to cut his hair then maybe we shouldn't even be going here. So we came here another time after that, this time with a different person and he was okay. He was good the first time but not as clean/thorough as I'd hoped. I thought Bob's service was the standard for this place but I guess not... Went 1 more time after that just to be sure and was worse, he got rushed out of there and didn't even get the standard service (hot towel and all) yet they still charged the same. Needless to say we won't be coming back.  *sigh* Now back to square one...

6/9/2014,-0.2675396825396825,Negative,I got the haircut and shave package today. The haircut was no big deal because I only needed a trim so I'd give that part a 3 out of 5 (a little above average). The shave was bad. I mean really bad. The razor felt dull and I could feel every single time the person was cutting me.  To make it worst tons of spots were left undone. So not only is my face cut up but I've got patches of hair.  I actually need to shave all the missed areas myself!,1

6/26/2014,0.18409871136615322,Positive,"I've been going to Roosters since I moved to Irvine in December 2013. I found them through Yelp, and decided to try it out for myself based on the fairly decent ratings and reviews.During your first visit, they have you fill out an information slip, so that when/if you decide to return for another haircut, your name and phone number will already be in their system.The interior is clean, wooden, and brightly lit. When you get there, you're offered a beverage - not sure on the choices, but I always just get water.The receptionists who answer the phone are always very friendly. When I called to make an appointment for my first visit, I asked for someone who could do a high fade comb over with a hard part and was recommended I see Edgar.Edgar is really friendly and professional. He listened to how I wanted to cut and style my hair, especially since it was the first time we were working with each other. He is very clean and precise with his work. You can tell that he's very careful with his cuts, because he turns the chair and steps back to look at you to double check his work is progressing well. The cut, wash, style and neck shave took around 45 minutes total.Not really sure how it's decided, but sometimes when I pay, they give me a ""$5 off"" coupon that you can use toward your next haircut.I ended up returning back to Edgar for two more haircuts following my first visit.Once recently, I wanted to make an appointment with Edgar but he wasn't in. The receptionist recommended and booked me with Rob.I've seen Rob twice thus far, and he is definitely my new favorite. Rob is talkative, friendly, yet quick and professional. During my first cut with Rob, he made me feel comfortable and took my somewhat extensive demands and knew exactly what I wanted my hair to look like. During my second cut with Rob, I was surprised that he remembered a lot of stuff we talked about during my first visit. It definitely made me feel like he genuinely converses with his clients and that he takes the time to get to know them. I go in right before work, so Rob is mindful of the time and gets me in and out of there within 35 minutes.",0

They gave me the guy, and I said cool.  Couldn't remember the last time a guy cut my hair, so that added a little extra twist.I usually have different options to get a haircut, but it depends how much time and hassle I want to know a lady. There's a place by my house which charges $20-25, but they are always very busy, varying quality, and usually try to upsell. The rest may cost less but aren't very convenient or good either, so I went here even though it was more expensive and hadn't even checked any reviews.Explained what I was looking for and the haircut seemed to be going well. Took a lot of extra time to put the cape on me just right then began cutting. Asked me to check the length in the front and I requested a touch shorter (not usually the case, but I was glad he asked, and beat the alternative).  After that, he shaved my sideburns and back of neck with straight razor without batting an eyelash which was impressive and didn't leave even a hint of irritation. This is something I've had a real problem with in the past when someone tries to use one on me, to the point of even having ingrown hairs on the back of my neck weeks later. Not good then, but my guy had the years of experience and the right touch.  Next washed and rinsed my hair out and dried and styled it. In the end I was really impressed with the results, and didn't need to go home and fix the way it looked or have a bunch of hair all over me which happens pretty much every other place I've ever gone without fail.The sink on the back of my neck was pretty uncomfortable and water got super hot for a split second I'm not gonna lie. But I'm a man and didn't bother me after the fact so it's all good.  No harm then there was no foul, right...?  The products they used were outstanding and I've pretty much used them all, from the cheap but reliable to the most expensive froo froo goo (some of which I still have at home, due to it's overhyped claims). The guy showed me what he used and left it at that, knowing that if I was pleased I would surely buy some then or in the future. I didn't, but definitely would in the future... but no hard sell is what really matters.Paid my $35, thanked them with some pocket money and a goodbye.  Will definitely consider them in the future when it's time for another good haircut.  Be aware the guy I used (Augustin, I believe) is only there on Monday or Tuesday (can't remember), Thursday, and the occasional Sunday.   Definitely the same price range but better quality service than the other ""fancy men's"" salons in the area, which was something I definitely noticed and will remember...",0

Now I'm stuck looking like a business man for a month or so. Not worth the money I paid. She sold me on the pomade she used because it felt nice in my hair and smelled great. She guaranteed that no matter how much I use, it won't flake. Turns out that was a lie. I used three finger tip sized scoops and two hours later my hair was flakey.

4/15/2013,-0.08244047619047618,Negative,"Extremely disappointing is a good way to sum up my experience at Roosters.  The first time I went, the cut was not done correctly, even after trying to get the stylist to correct it twice.  Today, I decided to give it another try with a different stylist.  The cut is so bad, I'm going to have to figure out how to hide the bald spot she created in the left side of my hair.  Furthermore, the right side burn is at a sharp slant, while the one on the left side is somewhat straight.  For the price, you can go to mega clips and get the same awful hair cut.  I will never return.  Please beware.",1
4/23/2014,0.1572916666666667,Positive,"An incredible place to get an all-around over-the-top quality haircut. I wouldn't call this a barbershop but more of a place to get yourself groomed and cleaned up, especially if you're in for a big event and need a precise well-rounded haircut. Edgar, the person who cut my hair, did an incredible job. He cut my hair in a way that no other barber or stylist had done before. As far as line-ups and tapers go, I felt as if that element was not up to par than other places I had been to, but as a whole, the haircut I recieved here was probably one of the better ones.The only downside to this place is the pricing. I ended up paying close to $40, which is a little over my budget, especially if I am wanting to come back every month or so. There are other good up-to-par barbers and stylists out there who cut hair, if not better for a much lower price.Chances of me going back on a regular basis is rare unless I am truly in the need to get fully groomed.",0
4/22/2014,0.4033333333333333,Positive,Great cut but high prices and prepare to wait if you're a walk-in. Higher staffing levels and a reduced pricing structure would make me go here for every cut.,0

4/24/2014,0.2041666666666667,Positive,I totally agree. $35 is a little too steep. Been there an hour ago. Great hair cut. But $35 doesn't match with the service. The cutter who cut my hair even expecting tip.,0
11/7/2013,0.4966666666666667,Positive,The haircut was great. The service was excellent. I love the scalp massage and shampoo etc. it makes the price worth it (35).

Santiago, and he is by far one of the best stylists ive eer had. he takes a lot care into his craft and treats my hair like a blank canvas for which he is able to do his artistic flair on. a very committed stylist that i plan on staying with and suggesting to others. as for everyone else, i'm sure the other stylists are just as amazing, even when i don't choose them they still manage to keep great conversation.

2/18/2015,0.30900297619047623,Positive,"Came in on a whim one day because it's right across the street from my job and I needed a quick cut. I sat in the chair with Josh and I haven't let another barber touch my hair or beard since. Perfect fade, perfect cut, and the cleanest hardline everytime. And when it comes time to trim and shape the beard, the man is an absolute guru. Exactly what I want, even when I don't really know how to describe what I'm asking for. On top of that, he's actually a really cool guy too, not some pretentious ""way too hip for you"" kind of barber that you find some other places. By the time you're walking out the door, if you don't look good, well, then that's a personal issue. As long as Josh is piloting the clippers, this barbershop is going to keep my business on the regular.",0
1/2/2015,0.34125,Positive,"Fantastic barber shop.  This is easily the best haircut that I have gotten in this area.  I told her what I wanted and told her to run with it and I ended up with a cut that looked great.  While this place is a runs a little expensive, the cut that I got still looks great two weeks later meaning I don't have to go in as often.  Definitely recommend this location if you looking for an exceptional haircut.",0
5/11/2013,0.14652777777777778,Positive,$40 is a little pricey for a haircut however Santiago really did a good job. He definitely knows what he's doing & understands hair.

6/22/2013,0.1654761904761905,Positive,great haircut!I've been coming here for the last few months and Anita never fails to hook it up with an amazing cut. I have a specific style I want (comb over fade with a design) and although its hard to cut she always delivers.,0
7/13/2013,0.2877976190476191,Positive,"Found Roosters because they are a sponsor of Irvine Pony Baseball.  Took my son there for a haircut after opening day, and since then this is the only place my son will go for a haircut.As the parent of a child with multiple cowlicks, Santiago has done a great job.  He took the time to listen to what I want and what has not worked in the past.  I came in saying that I trusted him because this is what he is trained to do and I have always been pleased with the results.  He has great patience with kids who are usually less than thrilled with having to get a hair cut.  Their price is about $5 more than one of the quick cut chain places, but based on results, well worth the money!My son likes coming too.  He likes that it is a place only for boys and the fact that there is a man that cuts is a bonus.  He also likes the fact that he gets a bottle of water while he waits.  It's the little things that make him happy.",0
3/6/2014,0.24122925685425686,Positive,"I have been to a lot of so called ""top rated"" barbers here in OC, and was not too impressed by some of their working..  I've had hair cuts at just about every stupid top rated place out there over the last few years, since my old barber quit from Logan Bros Shaving Co in Aliso Viejo.  I must say that JOSH here at Roosters, did an Excellent job!!  He really took the time to get to know exactly what I wanted, and added a little better style to what I had going up there.  My dome piece is looking pretty damn fresh!  He also hit me with a pretty sick hard part!!  Perfect temp on the hot towel, easy to talk to, and the facilities there were extremely clean and professional.  I knew this place was also legit when I saw that they had Aveda Pure-Formance grooming clay!!  I have to order that shiznit online from Nordstrom, and haven't found a better hair sculpting product out there, so I was special ordering it before..   Really thought Josh was a cool guy, who was definitely deserving of a five star review.  If you go there I would definitely recommend asking for JOSH, but especially if you are looking to add a little more steeze to your look!!!  Thanks JOSH!!!  I'll see you for my next cut!!!",0
7/23/2013,0.1304166666666667,Positive,"The first time I came in I had a great experience with a stylist I think was named Jenni. I told her I was getting a haircut for a job interview and what I wanted. She gave me exactly what I wanted and was very nice to talk to....That was the last good experience I had with them.I came back a month or two later and had a gentleman do my hair. I told him I needed a professional and conservative haircut for a job interview I was going to. While he was cutting my hair I asked him if he enjoyed cutting hair and his exact response was ""ehh."" He could not speak clear English and so the conversation was dull. But when he turned me around to look at my haircut I was in disbelief. I asked for a professional conservative haircut and he gave me something a soccer player would have had. The sides were way too short and the front was a mess along with a ridiculous fade pattern in the back. There was nothing conservative or business professional about it. If you're looking to get a good haircut make sure you know who you're dealing with and NEVER let the guy who works there touch your hair.",0

Although Roosters charges about double what I was used to, I thought I would give it a try. It was definitely worth it. I have been to see Santiago a few times now and he has been great. Not only is he great to talk to, but his schedule is flexible and he is a really experienced barber. The extra perks that others have mentioned make it a great and relaxing experience.While I think guys looking for a high-end barber will be satisfied coming here, it is also a place for the average guy. This isn't a place that most anybody would feel out of place in. I definitely recommend it and would definitely recommend Santiago.",0
3/9/2014,0.4,Positive,Found this place a couple of months ago. Got a haircut and a shave which my wife loved. Went back for a second time and the service was even better. This is a must try if you want a great haircut and shave.,0
11/26/2012,0.33166666666666667,Positive,Great place to get a men's haircut. Santiago did great work on my hair on my first visit. Definitely going back as a regular. They also offer a free 'clean up' to keep you looking neat between haircuts. Much cheaper than 18/8 too. :-),0
1/8/2013,0.19265151515151518,Positive,"Unlike several posts here, I was coming from a more expensive salon. Michelle was awesome. When asking about my hair (which was so grown out that it was probably hard to tell what the heck my last cut looked like), she asked if I liked razors or scissors for the sides. Honestly, either is fine, but I've had bad experiences with over-dependence upon razors, so I hesitated and she sensed it and said she liked scissors. I'm sure it made it more difficult for her, but she did a fantastic job. Her ability to focus on what she was doing while also getting to know me (very easy to talk to) was amazing. She also patiently answered all my questions and gave good advice regarding styling (I am horrible at this). I will definitely return to her. Let's all hope that she doesn't go back to art school anytime soon. Thanks Michelle!",0

If anyone is looking for a fresh clean cut I suggest Santiago, he's been my main barber since the day they opened. I use to jump from barber shop to barber shop because i was never quite happy with the outcome until i stumbled upon Roosters and by luck Santiago was the one to work on my disaster of a hair. The man understands his way around hair and I left feeling like a whole new person. So I've been back ever two weeks or so. Definitely worth 5 stars!!",0

After reading Yelp reviews I tried Roosters and was not disappointed. Sheryl cut my hair and was excellent!

3/24/2013,0.19602150537634408,Positive,"I have to admit I was I one of those men who thought paying more than ten bucks for a hair cut was absurd. Today's experience at Roosters has changed my whole outlook on the getting a cut and a shave. When I first walked in I was greeted warmly by Roosters' owner John. He immediately offered me a cup a coffee and a quick review of what Roosters is all about. I actually walked in as YELP cameras were filming a review with John. I must say I really enjoyed watching John stumble through his lines. It made him more humble and real. I sat with stylist Santiago, he cut my hair and cleaned me up with the classic straight razor. It was professionally done like the old school barbers. What pushed the experience over the top was the straight razor full shave performed by stylist Cynthia. The hot towels, the massage oils, the the clean shave and my favorite, the iced towel at the end to close the pores, need I say more. I left Roosters feeling fully relaxed, refreshed, and energized. I completely understand that the Roosters experience isn't just a haircut that you would get at the local barber shop, it's the atmosphere, the people and how you feel when you walk out the doors. I highly recommend the Roosters experience I know I will be back. Oh And look out for me in the YELP video coming soon, I might make the final cut ;)",0
